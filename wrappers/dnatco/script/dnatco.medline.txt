AB  - By analyzing almost 120 000 dinucleotides in over 2000 nonredundant nucleic acid 
      crystal structures, we define 96+1 diNucleotide Conformers, NtCs, which describe 
      the geometry of RNA and DNA dinucleotides. NtC classes are grouped into 15 codes 
      of the structural alphabet CANA (Conformational Alphabet of Nucleic Acids) to 
      simplify symbolic annotation of the prominent structural features of NAs and 
      their intuitive graphical display. The search for nontrivial patterns of NtCs 
      resulted in the identification of several types of RNA loops, some of them 
      observed for the first time. Over 30% of the nearly six million dinucleotides in 
      the PDB cannot be assigned to any NtC class but we demonstrate that up to a half 
      of them can be re-refined with the help of proper refinement targets. A 
      statistical analysis of the preferences of NtCs and CANA codes for the 16 
      dinucleotide sequences showed that neither the NtC class AA00, which forms the 
      scaffold of RNA structures, nor BB00, the DNA most populated class, are sequence 
      neutral but their distributions are significantly biased. The reported automated 
      assignment of the NtC classes and CANA codes available at dnatco.org provides a 
      powerful tool for unbiased analysis of nucleic acid structures by structural and 
      molecular biologists.
