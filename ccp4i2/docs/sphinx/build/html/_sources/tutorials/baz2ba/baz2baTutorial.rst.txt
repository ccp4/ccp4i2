Scenario
--------

As part of a chemical-­‐‑probe discovery project, you have established a
soakable crystal system into which you have soaked a fragment library. A
high resolution structure for “apo” (ligand free) crystals has been
solved, and you are confident that ligand soaking will not change the
crystal form (AN ASSUMPTION THAT IS NOT WITHOUT DANGER).

You have retrieved your autoprocessed data from the synchrotron and will
adopt the unmerged data generated by XIA2 as your start point to find
the ligand.

Task 1: Data import – Import from Xia2
--------------------------------------

|image1|

HINT: The “Look in” element of the file browser offers a pull-­‐‑down of
known project directories from which you might set off to find the files
you want to import. At the bottom of the list is “CCP4I2_TOP” which is
an alias for the ccp4i2 source code. For the import xia2 task, you need
to locate and select the subdirectory
`demo_data/baz2b/BAZ2BA_x839.xia2 <../baz2b/BAZ2BA_x839.xia2>`__

Now run the job

Question: locate the elements of the report that explain the selection
of spacegroup, and the selection of output resolution

Task 2: Ligand pipeline
-----------------------

|Ligand Pipeline Task| |Ligand Pipeline Workflow|

Principle inputs to the Ligand pipeline are reflections, an isomorphous
model, and a ligand dictionary. This pipeline, however, also embeds two
other pipelines (data reduction and make ligand) to allow it to start
further upstream, with unmerged data and a sketch, mol file, or SMILES
string.

There is a small advantage to starting from unmerged data here (since
the isomorphous model will be used as a reference to ensure consistent
assignment of space group and choice of reciprocal space asymmetric
unit)

The ligand can be represented with the SMILES string

``CN1C(C=Cc2ccccc12)=O``

The native PDB file is: `BAZ2B.pdb <BAZ2B.pdb>`__

HINT: to make sure no waters are copied across to confuse the ligand
placement part of the pipeline, provide the selection: not (HOH)
