Data types
==========

   Within CCP4i2 each instance of data is a file in our standard format
   - if you have data in non-standard format it will be converted on
   import. The reflection data is no longer all in one 'monster' MTZ
   file but split into 'mini' MTZ files containing either *Reflections*,
   *Phases*, *Map coefficients* or *Free R set*\ s - `more
   info <../general/data_files.html>`__\ . The key data describing the
   model are *Sequence* and *Atomic model*; the *Restraint dictionary*
   defines ideal structure geometry for model refinement - `more
   info <../general/model_data.html>`__.

   The different types of data have distinctive icons - where these
   appear in input guis, reports, or on the *Job list* you can use the
   icons to drag-and-drop the data around the gui and right-mouse click
   on the icon gives a menu with options including to view the data.

Overview
========

   The key stages in structure solution are shown - the initial *data
   processing* produces merged *Reflection* data that can be used in
   *Molecular replacement* (if you have similar known model structure)
   or *Experimental phasing* to solve the structure and give either
   initial *Phases* or an initial *Atomic model* that can be used for
   further *Model building and refinement*. The final refined *Atomic
   model* can then be validated, analysed and submitted to the Protein
   Databank.

   These key stages correspond to the *modules* on the *Task menu* of
   the gui (though there are additional modules there).

Data reduction and analysis
===========================

   The first steps in CCP4i2 will depend on the status of your
   experimental data: if you are starting from experimental image data
   you will need to *Integrate X-ray images* to create unmerged
   reflection data or you may have data that has been processed by
   *XIA2* at a synchrotron and the data and details of *XIA2* run can be
   imported by *Import integrated X-ray reflections* module.

   The unmerged *Reflection* data is merged by a *Data reduction* task
   that also provides important analysis of the data. Unmerged data can
   be entered here in a variety of formats and the output will be merged
   *Reflection* data and *Free R set*. The *Data reduction and analysis*
   module has other tools to analyse the *Reflection* data.

Experimental phasing
====================

   There are two totally automated experimental phasing tasks: *CRANK2*
   that uses a variety of programs and can continue to model building
   and refinement and *Shelx* that uses the various Shelx programs. Both
   produce *Phases* and initial *Map coefficients*\ and initial *Atomic
   model*.

Molecular replacement
=====================

   The *Molecular replacement* module includes tools to truncate or edit
   the search model prior to molecular replacement and then two
   different programs: *Phaser* or *Molrep* that should output initial
   *Phases*, *Map coefficients* and *Atomic model*.

Model building and refinement
=============================

   This module has a variety of tasks: *Density modification* can be
   used to improve initial *Phases* and *Autobuild protein* will quickly
   build or extend a protein structure. The structure can then be
   improved by cycles of *Refinement* and *Manual model building*. The
   *Ligand pipeline* can be used to generate initial coordinates and
   ligand geometry data for refinement.
