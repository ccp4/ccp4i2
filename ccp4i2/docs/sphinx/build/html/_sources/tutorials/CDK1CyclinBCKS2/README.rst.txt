CCP4i2 Tutorial: Inhibitor-bound ternary complex of CDK1, Cyclin B1 and CKS2
============================================================================

A ternary complex of CDK1 bound to Cyclin B1 and CKS2, bound to a
pyrazole inhibitor

Data files
----------

-  `1hck.pdb <./1hck.pdb>`__ Chain A is monomeric CDK2, i.e. inactive
   conformation
-  `1jst.pdb <./1jst.pdb>`__ Chain A is CDK2 in complex with Cyclin A,
   i.e. in active conformation
-  `1buh.pdb <./1buh.pdb>`__ CKS1 in complex with CDK2
-  `2b9r.pdb <./2b9r.pdb>`__ Chains are all human cyclin B1
-  `CDK1CyclinBCKS2Compound23.mtz <./CDK1CyclinBCKS2Compound23.mtz>`__
-  `P06493.fasta <./P06493.fasta>`__ Sequence of human CDK2:
   crystallised species had an N-terminal GPLGS proteolysis artefact
-  `P14635.fasta <./P14635.fasta>`__ Sequence of human Cyclin B1:
   crystallised species was untagged residues 175-432
-  `P33552.fasta <./P33552.fasta>`__ Sequence of human CKS2:
