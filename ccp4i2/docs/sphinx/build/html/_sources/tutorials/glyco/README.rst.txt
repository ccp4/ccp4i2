CCP4i2 Tutorial: Glyco (PDB:4IID)
=================================

This dataset can be used to test the carbohydrate validation task.

The glycoprotein presented here is a glycosyl hydrolase of the family
GH3, from *Aspergillus aculeatus*, and shows long High-mannose
N-glycans. The resolution of the data is 2.3Ã…, which implies that
torsion restraints should be used in order to keep realistic chemistry
during the refinement. In this case, however, several carbohydrates
deviate from their minimal-energy conformation. The task 'Validation of
carbohydrate structures' may be used to detect those outliers and flag
them up in 'Manual model rebuilding'.

Data files
----------

The data files required for this tutorial are in the demo_data/glyco folder. You should
see a demo_data entry in the File Browser side bar. If not you can use 
Utilities -> Copy demo data to project -> glyco to copy the files into your project.

-  **4iid.pdb**: Deposited structure.
-  **4iid.mtz**: MTZ file containing amplitudes and sigmas.
