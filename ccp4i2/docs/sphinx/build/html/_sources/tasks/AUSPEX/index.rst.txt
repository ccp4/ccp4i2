   The main input to the task is a reflection file, which may be any of
   the standard formats (mtz, mmcif). In addition the user can tailor the
   style and content of the output graphs using to suit their purposes.

   The output images are recorded by the ccp4i2 database, and can easily be
   exported for external use (as in other interfaces, by right clicking on
   the data icon and selecting export).
