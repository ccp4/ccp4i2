Model Building with ARP/wARP
############################
   ARP/wARP is a software package for the automated building of protein
   models from a given set of estimated phases. ARP/wARP is installed as
   part of the default settings in a standard CCP4 installation, but users
   should check this is indeed the case if they experience problems.

Input
=====
   In order to run ARP/wARP in ccp4i2 you need to provide, at a
   minimum, a set of experimental data and correspoding phases, along
   with a defined asymmetric unit.

   Phase information can also be defined for further refinement.
