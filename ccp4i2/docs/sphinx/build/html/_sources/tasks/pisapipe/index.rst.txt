Structure analysis with PISA
############################

   The PISA program analyses crystal structures to identify the
   component chemical monomers and the interfaces between the monomers
   including the monomers generated by applying symmetry to the input
   file coordinates. PISA will also evaluate the strength of interaction
   between the neighbouring monomers in a crystal and predict what would
   be the most stable multimer and therefore the most likely biological
   form of the structure.

Input
=====

   |image1|

   The input to the task is a PDB file containing the structure to be
   analysed.

Results
=======

   |image2|
   
   The report contains two main tables, the first describing the
   assemblies which were found, and the second describing the interfaces
   between the monomers in an assembly.

   .. rubric:: Assemblies table
      :name: assemblies-table

   This table gives information about the possible quaternery structures
   ("assemblies") that PISA predicts. The table summarises the predicted
   assemblies.

   The summary for each assembly consists of the following information:

      **mmSize** is the number of macromolecular monomeric units in each
      assembly (consisting of protein and/or RNA/DNA, but not ligands),
      and the number of assemblies in the unit cell. For example: "2x6"
      indicates that the assembly contains 6 macromolecular monomeric
      units, and, for the given PQS set, a unit cell contains 2
      assemblies of this type.

      **Formula** and **composition** give respectively the chemical
      make up of the assembly. Note that the formula doesn't use the
      chain ids from the entry, whereas the composition does.

      **ASA, BSA** etc Details of solvent accessible and buried surface
      areas, and the solvation free energy on formation (ΔG\ :sup:`int`)
      and disassociation (ΔG\ :sup:`diss`) of the assembly.

   .. rubric:: Notation for structures
      :name: notation-for-structures

   Structures are indicated using the following notation.

   Full chains without a chain ID are denoted **{-}**. Ligands are
   denoted:

   **[R]C:N**

   where R is the residue or ligand name, C is the chain, and N is the
   residue number. For example, [HEM]-:605 means protoporhyrin IX
   containing Fe (HEM) in chain without a chain ID, residue number 605.

   .. rubric:: Interfaces table
      :name: interfaces-table

   Interfaces between pairs of "structures" (i.e. chains and ligands)
   within the entry.

   A results table shows details of each interface found, with one
   interface per row of the table:

      **Structure 1** is defined as a range of residues or as as a
      ligand name. {-} indicates the whole chain; other structures are
      the ligands and hetatm groups indicated as e.g. [GOL]-:1001.

      **Structure 2** is the second component which interfaces with the
      first. It is defined in a similar way to structure 1, however an
      additional symmetry operation is supplied (expressed either as a
      string or as a code).

   For each structure the number of interfacing atoms
   (:sup:`i`\ N\ :sub:`at`) and residues (:sup:`i`\ N\ :sub:`res`) are
   indicated.

   For each interface a number of quantities are listed:

      **Interface area (in A\ 2)**

      | **Δ\ i\ G** expressed in kcal/M, and an associated "P-value".
        Δ\ :sup:`i`\ G is the solvation free energy gain on formation of
        the interface, with negative values indicating a hydrophobic
        interface.
      | The P-value is a probability measure of the specificity of the
        interface:

         P=0.5 indicates that the Δ\ :sup:`i`\ G value is typical for
         this type of interface.

         P>0.5 means that the interface is less hydrophobic than
         expected, suggesting that it is an artefact of crystal packing.

         P<0.5 indicates interfaces with an unexpectedly large
         hydrophobicity, and thus a high specificity.

      **N\ HB, N\ SB** The number of potential hydrogren bonds
      (N\ :sub:`HB`) and salt bridges (N\ :sub:`SB`) across the
      interface

      **CSS** The "complexation significance score" CSS, which scores
      how significant the interface is for assembly formation.

   A link (in the column labelled "x") launches the selected viewer to
   visualise the interface. Clicking on the interface number (in the
   column marked "NN") links to more detail about the interface in
   question.
