Validation of carbohydrate structures (Privateer)
#################################################

   Privateer will scan an input structure for kwown cyclic carbohydates,
   reporting their conformation, stereochemistry, connectivity and
   geometric parameters. It will also calculate a Real Space Correlation
   Coefficient (RSCC) against omit mFo-DFc density. It will also output
   2mFo-DFc coefficients, and a visual checklist for improving the model
   in Coot.

Input
=====

   |image1|

   Privateer just requires a model and a set of reflections (including
   sigmas) to work **(1)**. The model will be scanned for known cyclic
   carbohydrates (some popular Nitrogen-substituted compounds are also
   supported) and then the structure factor and map coefficient
   calculations will begin. Sugars will be omitted from phase
   calculation, effectively producing omit mFo-DFc map coefficients.

   Once Privateer has calculated model and experimental electron
   densities, a correlation analysis is performed within the boundaries
   of a mask calculated around the studied sugar. This mask can be
   adjusted by tweaking its radius, as shown below. Then, a
   conformational (using the Cremer-Pople algorithm) and stereochemical
   analysis will follow.

   It is possible to analyse a single sugar (supported or not) by typing
   its three-letter code in **(2)**. The sugar model must follow the
   standard naming scheme, with C1-C5 plus O5 in the ring (C2-C6 plus O6
   for ketoses).

Advanced options
----------------

   |image2|

   It is possible to change the radius for the mask that is used for the
   correlation analysis **(3)**. A typical value would be between 1.5 to
   2.5 Angstroems, with smaller values being more forgiving with
   modelling errors than higher ones.

Results

Conformational validation
-------------------------

   Cyclic carbohydrates usually have clear conformational preferences in
   terms of energy. Enzymes can force sugars into higher-energy
   conformations in order to achieve catalysis, and these conformations
   should indeed be kept in mind when modelling a sugar in the -1 site
   of an enzyme. However, most of the time (*i.e.* in the rest of the
   cases) sugars stay in their original lowest-energy conformation,
   which for pyranoses is either a :sup:`4`\ C\ :sub:`1` or a
   :sup:`1`\ C\ :sub:`4` chair. When a sugar monomer is imported from a
   dictionary within a graphical model building program such as
   **Coot**, its ideal coordinates reflect the lowest-energy
   conformation, but during the course of refinement they can get
   distorted and driven away to other conformations such as envelopes or
   half-chairs. These distortions are usually triggered by:

      | **Weak density gradients**
      | Sometimes there is just partial density for a sugar that is
        known to be there (*e.g.* in a High-Mannose glycosylation tree),
        and it is the crystallographer's decision whether to model it or
        not. However, atempting to refine a model with such data without
        the appropriate restraints - **torsion restraints** can help in
        this case - will nearly always result in distortion.
      | **Wrong linkage distance specification**
      | Forcing refinement software to restrain a link to a wrong
        distance will make it fit the model with an offset equal to the
        deviation from the correct value. This can result just in an
        increased total puckering amplitude (Q) value if the deviation
        is not too high, or a complete conformational change for higher
        values.
      | **Mistaken anomer or handedness**
      | Trying to fit an alpha anomer into density that supports the
        beta anomer instead will result on a flat ring or a
        conformational change.

   We use the well-stablished Cremer-Pople algorithm (*Cremer and Pople,
   1975, JACS 97:1354-58*) at the core of our conformational analysis.
   This analysis gives one angle (Phi) and a total puckering amplitude
   (Q) for furanoses and two angles (*Phi*, *Theta*) and Q for
   pyranoses. The relationship between the different angles and
   conformations is reflected in the subsequent graphical representation
   of the conformational parameters:

      **Conformational landscape for furanose sugars.** Atoms without
      markup are roughly coplanar. This angle assignment implies a
      clockwise ordering of the ring atoms starting from the oxygen. An
      opposite-sense naming scheme would imply a 180째 shift in *Phi*.

      |image4|
      **Cremer-Pople sphere for pyranoses.** Chair conformations are
      located at the poles of the sphere, with the northern hemisphere
      being the one predominantly occupied by D-pyranoses (due to the
      configuration of the carbon linked to the highest-ranked in-ring
      carbon). Half-chairs and Envelopes, which have been omitted in
      order to produce a clearer figure, are located at *Theta*\ =45째
      and *Theta*\ =135째 in the northern and southern hemispheres
      respectively.

   The Cremer-Pople algorithm involves the calculation of a
   uniquely-defined mean plane that satisfies, among other conditions,
   that the sum of all the vertical distances from the ring atoms to
   that plane is zero. The stereochemistry can also be easily worked out
   by calculating equivalent displacements for those atoms relevant to
   it. After that, Privateer-validate compares the reported conformation
   and stereochemistry to those calculated for the idealised,
   lowest-energy structure of the studied sugar.

   If you choose to rebuild your structure with Coot after running
   Privateer, a visual guided tour of the reported issues will be
   automatically loaded. Torsion restraints will also be automatically
   turned on.
