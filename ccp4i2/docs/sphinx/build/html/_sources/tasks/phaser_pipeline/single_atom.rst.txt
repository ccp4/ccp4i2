Single atom Molecular Replacement
=================================

Single Atom Molecular Replacement with Phaser combines the MR and SAD phasing modes to solve high resolution structures. Firstly, single atoms are used for MR then log-likelihood gradient completion is performed with EP. The anomalous differences are not used in this step, only the mean structure factors.


Single atom MR is possible with very high resolution data.
