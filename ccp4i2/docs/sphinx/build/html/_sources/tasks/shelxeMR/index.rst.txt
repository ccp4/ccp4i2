Using SHELXE for Molecular Replacement
######################################
   Though it was originally designed for experimental phasing it may
   in certain cases be useful to use shelxe for certain Molecular Replacement
   problems. In these cases SHELXE is used for C-alpha tracing and density
   modification in an attempt to extend and improve models from a previous
   molecular replacement solution, given by one of the other tasks in ccp4i2.

Input
=====
   The user will need to provide the results from a previous MR solution.
   An estimate of the solvent content must also be given.

   Phase information can also be defined for further refinement.
