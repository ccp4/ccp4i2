Self-Rotation Function Analysis with Molrep
===========================================

    *A self-rotation function calculation and visualisation tool. It's used for preliminary analysis of X-Ray data*

The self-rotation function is a useful tool for determining how many molecules are present in the asymmetric unit and how they are related by noncrystallographic rotational symmetry.
