Intensities to amplitudes
#########################


   Reflection data can be in the form of intensities or amplitudes
   (structure factors) and tasks will accept either and perform any
   necessary interconversion automatically. This task is provided 'just
   in case' you need to perform the conversion, probably for use outside
   CCP4i2 or wish to see the data analysis that goes with the
   conversion.

Input
=====

   |image1|
