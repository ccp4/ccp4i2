Align sequences - CLUSTALW
##########################

   This interface accesses a small part of ClustalW2 functionality in
   order to align two or more protein sequences using default program
   parameters.

Input
=====

   |image1|
   You can enter input sequences with all sequences in an alignment file
   or as a list of sequences.\ **(1)**

   To enter multiple sequences files select the first in the *Sequence*
   line **(2)** and then click the '+' button **(3)** to create the next
   element in the sequence list.

   The supported formats for alignment and sequences files are described
   in the `Model data documentation <../../general/model_data.html>`__.
   CCP4i2 will convert imported alignment and sequences files to its
   internal standard formats: Clustal for alignment files and Fasta for
   sequence files.

Results
=======

      The results are output in a Clustal format alignment file and are
      shown in the report.
