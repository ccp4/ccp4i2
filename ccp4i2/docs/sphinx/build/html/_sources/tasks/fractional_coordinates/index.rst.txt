Add Fractional Coordinates
==========================

Fractional coordinates are used to specify there is an atom located in the unit cell. They are expressed as fractions of the unit cell in each of the three directions a, b, c separated by the angles α, β, γ. 

The advantage of using fractional coordinates instead of absolute ones is that special positions are immediately recognized. That makes certain operations such as comparing symmetry relations more easily done in fractional space.
