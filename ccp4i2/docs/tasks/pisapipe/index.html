      <p>The PISA program analyses crystal structures to identify the component chemical monomers and the interfaces between the monomers including the monomers generated by applying symmetry to the input file coordinates. PISA will also evaluate the strength of interaction between the neighbouring monomers in a crystal and predict what would be the most stable multimer and therefore the most likely biological form of the structure.</p>

      <p>The input to the task is a PDB file containing the structure to be analysed.</p>

      <p>The report contains two main tables, the first describing the assemblies which were found, and the second describing the interfaces between the monomers in an assembly.</p>

      <h2>Assemblies table</h2>
      <p>This table gives information about the possible quaternery
      structures ("assemblies") that PISA predicts. The table
      summarises the predicted assemblies.</p>

      <p>The summary for each assembly consists of the following
      information:</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p><b>mmSize</b> is the number of macromolecular monomeric
          units in each assembly (consisting of protein and/or RNA/DNA, but
          not ligands), and the number of assemblies in the unit cell.
          For example: "2x6" indicates that the assembly contains 6
          macromolecular monomeric units, and, for the given PQS set, a
          unit cell contains 2 assemblies of this type.</p>
      <p><b>Formula</b> and <b>composition</b> give respectively the
          chemical make up of the assembly. Note that the formula doesn't
          use the chain ids from the entry, whereas the composition
          does.</p>
      <p><b>ASA, BSA</b> etc Details of solvent accessible and buried surface areas,
          and the solvation free energy on formation (ΔG<sup>int</sup>)
          and disassociation (ΔG<sup>diss</sup>) of the assembly.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Notation for structures</h2>

      <p>Structures are indicated using the following notation.</p>

      <p>Full chains without a chain ID are denoted <b>{-}</b>. Ligands
      are denoted:</p>

      <p><b>[R]C:N</b></p>

      <p>where R is the residue or ligand name, C is the chain, and
      N is the residue number. For example, [HEM]-:605 means
      protoporhyrin IX containing Fe (HEM) in chain without a chain
      ID, residue number 605.</p>

      <h2>Interfaces table</h2>

      <p>Interfaces between pairs of "structures" (i.e. chains and ligands)
      within the entry.</p>

      <p>A results table shows details of each interface found, with one
      interface per row of the table:</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p><b>Structure 1</b> is defined as a range of residues or as
          as a ligand name. {-} indicates the whole chain; other
          structures are the ligands and hetatm groups indicated as
          e.g. [GOL]-:1001.</p>
      <p><b>Structure 2</b> is the second component which interfaces
          with the first. It is defined in a similar way to structure
          1, however an additional symmetry operation is supplied
          (expressed either as a string or as a code).</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>For each structure the number of interfacing atoms
      (<sup>i</sup>N<sub>at</sub>) and residues (<sup>i</sup>N<sub>res</sub>)
      are indicated.</p>

      <p>For each interface a number of quantities are listed:</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p><b>Interface area (in A<sup>2</sup>)</b></p>
      <p><b>&Delta;<sup>i</sup>G</b> expressed in kcal/M, and an associated
          "P-value". Δ<sup>i</sup>G is the solvation free energy
          gain on formation of the interface, with negative values
          indicating a hydrophobic interface.<br>
          The P-value is a probability measure of the specificity of
          the interface:
          <blockquote>
            <p>P=0.5 indicates that the Δ<sup>i</sup>G
                value is typical for this type of interface.</p>
            <p>P&gt;0.5 means that the interface is less hydrophobic
                than expected, suggesting that it is an artefact of
                crystal packing.</p>
            <p>P&lt;0.5 indicates interfaces with an unexpectedly
                large hydrophobicity, and thus a high specificity.</p>
          </blockquote>
          </p>
      <p><b>N<sub>HB</sub>, N<sub>SB</sub></b> The number of potential hydrogren bonds (N<sub>HB</sub>)
          and salt bridges (N<sub>SB</sub>) across the interface</p>
      <p><b>CSS</b> The "complexation significance score" CSS, which scores how
          significant the interface is for assembly formation.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>A link (in the column labelled "x") launches the selected viewer
      to visualise the interface. Clicking on the interface number
      (in the column marked "NN") links to more detail about the interface
      in question.</p>
