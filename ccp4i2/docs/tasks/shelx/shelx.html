    The "Automated structure solution - Shelxcde" experimental phasing task builds a model automatically from intensities or amplitudes from single or multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD/MAD) or single isomorphous replacement (SIRAS) experiments.  The user can optionally start or end the automated pipeline at each of the steps below:  
<ol>
  <li>Substructure detection with <a href="http://shelx.uni-ac.gwdg.de/SHELX/shelxd_mm_keywords.php">SHELXD</a>
  using FA values obtained from <a href="http://shelx.uni-ac.gwdg.de/SHELX/shelxc_keywords.php">SHELXC</a></li>
  <li>Density modification and poly-alanine tracing with <a
  href="http://shelx.uni-ac.gwdg.de/SHELX/shelxe_keywords.php">SHELXE</a></li>
  <li>Model building with <a
  href="http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/html/cbuccaneer.html">Buccaneer</a>, or <a
  href="http://www.embl-hamburg.de/ARP/Manual/UserGuide7.5.html">ARP/wARP</a>
  iterated with model refinement with <a
  href="http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/html/refmac5.html">REFMAC</a></li>
  <li>Model refinement with REFMAC</li> </ol>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <figure><img src="shelxcde-input-labels.png"> <figcaption>    Figure 1: Main input</figcaption></figure>
     <p>A pipeline can be started or stopped at any stage <b class="img-ref">(1.1)</b>  For example, if an anomalously scattering substructure has been determined already, it can be input in PDB format
by selecting to start the pipeline at Density modification and poly-Ala tracing.</p>

    <p>Inputting a protein sequence <b class="img-ref">(1.2)</b> is beneficial for model building.  If it is not available, click off the Input protein sequence option and input the number of protein residues per monomer.</p>

    <p>Input the substructure atom element symbol (i.e. Se for Selenium) and the number of substructure atoms in the asymmetric unit <b class="img-ref">(1.3)</b>.  The number of substructure atoms in the asymmetric unit is the number of substructure atoms in your protein multiplied by the number of protein molecules that are present in the asymmetric unit.  For sulfur-SAD phasing of structures containing disulfide bonds, the sulfur atoms that make such bonds should be counted separately in the number of substructure sites, and the minimum distance between sites should be given as 1.5A in the "Advanced options" section (3.3). If the anomalous resolution is worse than about 2.1A, the disulfides will not be resolved, so the number of disulfides (i.e. "S-S pairs") should be specified and the minimum distance increased to 3.5A, but the number of sites is still the total number of anomalously scattering atoms.</p>

  <p>Input the anomalous reflections data in a merged MTZ file containing the Bijvoet/anomalous intensities or structure factor amplitudes <b class="img-ref">(1.5)</b>.  Alternatively, unmerged or merged XDS (XDS_ASCII.HKL), HKL2000 (.sca) or SHELX (.hkl) files can be input <b class="img-ref">(1.4)</b>. 
Inputting unmerged files is recommended if SHELXC is used since it can make use of it for improved estimates of FA values and reporting of statistics such as the anomalous correlation coefficient (CCanom1/2).
If non-MTZ reflection data is input, fields for crystal cell dimensions and spacegroup appear and are automatically filled by the ccp4i2 interface if the information exists in the input file.  If they have not been filled in, please input them.
For MAD data, the reflection data can be input for all the other wavelengths collected <b class="img-ref">(1.6)</b>.</p>  
    
    <p> If an isomorphic native data set is available, it should be input <b class="img-ref">(1.7)</b> as it typically extends to higher resolution.  
The native dataset is always used for building and refinement but it can be also used for SIRAS phasing:  If only a single anomalous dataset is input together with the native data, an option to switch between the SIRAS and SAD phasing can be selected under the "Important Paramaters" tab.

Finally, a previously defined cross-validation or "free" set can be input <b class="img-ref">(1.8)</b> or the cross-validation can be turned off, otherwise the default is to define a new set</p>.

<h2>Important Options</h2>
    <figure> <img src="crank2-important-options.png"> 
	    <figcaption> Figure 2: Important options </figcaption></figure>
    
    <p>This page (and the next one) offers options that can improve results if default (automatically determined) values are not optimal.
From the number of protein residues per monomer, the interface will obtain a guess for the number of molecules in the asymmetric unit and the solvent content based on a Matthew's coefficient analysis.  
These values are only a guess and (re-)running the task with 'correct' values can significantly improve results.</p>
    <figure> <img src="shelxcde-advanced-options-labels.png"> 
	    <figcaption> Figure 3: Advanced options</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Advanced Options</h2>
    <p>The third pane offers advanced options, ones you will not normally need to change for the first run. If you suspect that substructure detection was not successful, consider running different resolution cutoffs <b class="img-ref">(3.1)</b> and more trials <b class="img-ref">(3.2)</b> if the results indicate that there is an anomalous signal.  For sulfur-SAD phasing, as mentioned above, if your anomalous resolution is greater than 2.1, adjust the minimum distance between atoms <b class="img-ref">(3.3)</b> to 1.5.  Another useful option that can improve results is increasing the number of cycles of model building in SHELXE<b class="img-ref">(3.4)</b> or adjusting the solvent content and inputting the correct NCS copies in the "Important options" section.   
If the substructure is correct, it is faster to re-run SHELXE with different options from the "SHELX phasing and building" pipeline starting at Density modification and poly-Ala tracing.  The partial model and initial phases can also be input to the "CRANK2 phasing & building" pipeline and starting at Substructure improvement.  For all steps, the gui provides the ability to input custom keywords for individual programs (i.e. <b class="img-ref">(3.5)</b>, <b class="img-ref">(3.6)</b>). For example, inputting -t5 to SHELXE for predominantly beta sheet proteins can provide improved tracing, but also increase run time.  Please look at all the documentation for individual programs (links shown
above) to see supported keywords.  Multiple options can be inputted, separated by a comma.</p>

While the task is running, graphs are updated to indicate the performance for each step.  
After and typically also while each step is being performed, a summary with statistics indicating the performance is provided.  
For many graphs, a shaded gray area is shown to indicate a region with poor statistics.
For some steps, the user may click on a button on the bottom right panel of the Results section to stop the current step.  
If the button is pressed, the step will be stopped after finishing the current iteration and the next step of the pipeline will follow. 
This can be used to save time if the user is happy with the results of the current step as indicated by the Results report.

<h3>FA estimation</h3>
<p>
<figure class="small"> <img src="danosigdano.png"><figcaption>Figure 4: Anomalous difference to noise versus resolution </figcaption></figure>
Besides generating the FA values, this step may also provide useful information about the input datasets. 
Figure 4 shows the graph of Dano/Sigdano - a measure of the anomalous signal strength - as a function of resolution.  The larger the number, the greater the signal and a value of about 0.8 indicates zero signal.  
If unmerged data was input, the graph of CCAnom1/2 - the anomalous difference correlation within a dataset - versus resolution (Figure 5) <figure class="small"> <img src="anom-cchalf.png"><figcaption>Figure 5: Anomalous difference correlation within dataset</figcaption></figure>
 is shown. Again the larger the number, the greater the signal and values over approximately 30% indicate a significant anomalous signal.  
Evaluating these graphs is useful if the substructure was not correctly identified and the user should re-run the task by manually inputting a resolution cutoff, or even several jobs varying the cutoff for difficult cases with small anomalous signals.  
Similarly, in the case of a MAD experiment, the signed anomalous correlation between data sets is shown (Figure 6) <figure class="small"> <img src="signed-anom-diff-correl-MAD.png"><figcaption>Figure 6: Anomalous difference correlation between MAD datasets</figcaption></figure>.  If there is a significant anomalous signal for different wavelengths, a high anomalous difference correlation for them will be present (above 30%).</p>

<h3>Substructure detection</h3>
<p><figure class="threequarter"> <img src="shelxd-occ-cc-ccweak.png"><figcaption>Figure 7: Summary, Occupancy and CC versus CCweak for the trials graphs</figcaption></figure></p>

<p><figure class="small"> <img src="cfom-trials.png"><figcaption>Figure 8: Distribution of CFOM from trials</figcaption></figure></p>


<p>A good indication that the substructure has been correctly determined is if the threshold (i.e. CFOM in the case of SHELXD) has been reached before the maximum number of cycles has been performed: 
the report summary for the Substructure detection step will state this.  
A division of trials in the Distribution of CFOM (Figure 7) is also an encouraging indicator: 
the graph shows the separation of incorrect (lower CFOM) trials from correct (higher CFOM) solutions.  
This division can also be observed as clustering in a graph of CC against CCweak where the trials (shown in circles) in the the top right indicate correct solutions with higher values of CC and CCweak. 
However, some datasets, especially those with small anomalous signals, show little discrimination between the CFOM of solutions and of wrong substructures.

The graph of occupancies versus atom number details the number of significant peaks that have been found and can be used cautiously to indicate the number of substructure atoms and protein molecules in the asymmetric unit.  </p>

<h3>Density modification and poly-alanine trace</h3>
<p>
    <figure class="medium"> <img src="shelxe-summary-cc.png"> 	    <figcaption>Figure 9: Summary and correlation coefficient of enantiomorphs</figcaption></figure>
The results and summary of running density modification and initial model building for both substructure enantiomorphs is presented.  A significant difference in between both hands for the correlation coefficient in model building (Figure 9), 
    <figure class="small"> <img src="shelxe-contrast.png"> 	    <figcaption>Figure 11: Contrast between enantiomorphs</figcaption></figure>
contrast (Figure 11) and 
    <figure class="small"> <img src="shelxe-residues.png"> 	    <figcaption>Figure 10: Residues built for enantiomorphs</figcaption></figure>
residues built (Figure 10), 
    <figure class="small"> <img src="shelxe-chain-length.png">      <figcaption>Figure 12: Chain lengths of enantiomorphs</figcaption></figure>
chain length (Figure 12) are promising sign.  The most important number output by shelxe is the CC for the traces against the native data. If this is greater than 25%, the structure is probably solved. This is still true even if a totally incorrect protein sequence has been provided! 
</p>

<h3>Model building</h3>
<p>
    <figure class="threequarter"> <img src="residues-per-cycle-and-rcomb.png"> 
	    <figcaption>Figure 13: Summary and graphs of Residues, FOM and Rfactors</figcaption></figure>
</p>
The model building summary (Figure 13) will indicate whether a majority of the model was correctly built.  
In the graphs, an R-factor under 40% and a large number of residue built in a small number of fragments are good indication of success.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Model refinement</h3>
<p>
    <figure class="medium"> <img src="refine-refmac.png"> 
	    <figcaption>Figure 14: Summary and graphs of Rfactors</figcaption></figure>
Finally, the model refinement summmary (Figure 14) quotes the R-factors versus the cycle number: lower R-factors (underneath 40%) are a good indication and a small difference between the working and free R-factors is positive.  In general, the R-values should plateau - if this hasn't occurred, and the R-factors are still going down, more refinement steps can further improve the model.
