      <p>Difficult molecular replacement problems (e.g. homology less
      than 30%) can be helped by
      trimming loops and side chains from the target model where it
      has poor sequence alignment to the search sequence. To run this
      task you can enter either the search sequence for which the task will
      perform an alignment to the template structure or you may import
      your preferred alignment. You may get a
      better alignment of the template and target sequence from
      tools such as HHPred, PROMALS3D or FFAS.  The supported sequence
      and alignment formats are described in the <a href="../../general/model_data.html">Model data
      documentation</a>.</p>

      <p><b class="img-ref">(1)</b>Pruning side chain alternative modes (from <a href="https://www.phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/sculptor.html">Phenix documentation</a>):
    <b>schwarzenbacher</b> Implements the algorithm published by
      Schwarzenbacher et al. (2004), who propose that for optimal
      molecular replacement results a residue sidechain should be
      truncated if aligned with a non-identical residue, and not
      truncated otherwise. The level of truncation is controlled by
      the pruning_level parameter, and defaults to 3 (which
      corresponds to Cgamma) and can be controlled by the
      pruning_level parameter of the schwarzenbacher scope.
    <b>Similarity</b> Uses sequence similarity values for deciding the level of truncation. Residues above full_truncation_limit are not truncated at all, those below the full_truncation_limit are truncated to Cbeta, and those in between are truncated according to the pruning_level parameter (all available from the similarity scopei). Results tend to be similar to those given by the Schwarzenbacher algorithm; however, it is possible to get high similarity values (and full sidechain preservation) for certain substitutions (i.e. TYR to PHE), and low-sequence similarity zones can end up being truncated to Cbeta. </p>
<p><b class="img-ref">(2)</b>B factor of model:
<b>original</b> This uses the original B-factor of atoms. This is
      primarily intended as a contributor to a combination, but can
      also be used to manipulate current B-factors, e.g. set them to a
constant value.
<b>asa</b> This calculates accessible surface area for an isolated
      chain and transforms the raw values to B-factors. A high
      ASA-value indicates a potential for flexibility. The calculation
      can be configured by the precision and probe_radius parameters
of the asa scope.
<b>similarity</b> Low sequence similarity regions tend to be more dissimilar.
