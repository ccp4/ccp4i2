     <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Low Resolution Structure Refinement Pipeline (LORESTR) is a fully automated and easy-to-use tool.</p>
      <p>The minimal input required is a PDB file containing the current model (the target 
      structure) and corresponding diffraction data. In automatic mode, 
      LORESTR extracts the sequences of all chains present in the PDB file and runs a BLAST search 
      over the whole Protein Data Bank (internet connection required). It then downloads up to ten homologues 
      that share at least 75% sequence identity and cover at least 75% of the protein chain (only homologues 
      satisfying these criteria proved to improve refinement). LORESTR specifies for ProSMART hydrogen bond 
      restraints to be used for any chains for which there are no close homologues found. Users can also 
      manually supply any number of homologous structures.</p>
      <p>After downloading homologues, the pipeline analyses the input data in order to determine the set 
      of most appropriate refinement parameters. It checks whether the data are derived from a twinned crystal, 
      in which case automated handling of twinning in REFMAC5 is enabled. The pipeline also tries standard 
      and least-squares scaling options, selecting the one that performs better (gives lower Rfree) and figures 
      out solvent parameters.</p>
      <p>The pipeline then generates a number of refinement protocols, depending on the number of available 
      homologous chains. If no homologues are supplied and no homologues are found during the BLAST search, 
      the pipeline will just test the two protocols that do not require availability of external homologues, 
      i.e. hydrogen bond restraints and jelly-body restraints. For all protocols for which external homologues 
      are available, the pipeline runs one round of REFMAC5 refinement using the external restraints, before 
      then executing a second round of refinement using only jelly-body restraints in order to allow the 
      structure to relax into its new conformation (as this approach proved to be optimal in the vast majority 
      of our test cases).</p>
      <p>The pipeline supports multitasking and can run several jobs in parallel, should the user so wish. 
      After running all jobs, LORESTR selects the best-performing protocol according to a quality indicator 
      that depends on both Rfree and the MolProbity score, or just simply Rfree if MolProbity is not available 
      from a local PHENIX installation (phenix.molprobity shall be in the $PATH for automated assesment of the
      structure quality).

      <h2>Input</h2>
      <img src="lorestr_i2_task_1.png">
      <p>LORESTR input is simple: a target model for refinement and experimental data, including Rfree.</p>
      <p>Also, you may provide optional file with TLS coefficients and any number of homologous structures 
      for restraints generation. Please note, that if you are using auto mode (which is recommended default),
      the pipeline will automatically download homologous structures from the PDB, so you don't need to 
      provide them manually. However, you can use auto mode and manually supplied homologous structures
      simultaneously (for instance, when you have both unpublished structures of your protein and homologues
      deposited to the PDB).</p>
      <br/>
      <h2>Options</h2>
      <img src="lorestr_i2_task_2.png">
      <p><b>Auto mode: </b> recommended default. In this mode pipeline extracts the sequences of all 
      chains present in the PDB file, runs a BLAST search over the whole Protein Data Bank and downloads
      appropriate homologues for restraints generation. Internet connection is required for this functionality.</p>
      <p><b>Generate retraints for DNA/RNA chains:</b> please tick this box if you have DNA or RNA in your model</p>
      <p><b>Number of CPUs to use:</b> please specify number of processors for parallel execution of several
      refinement protocols.</p>
      <p><b>Run 100-200 cycles of jelly body refinement: </b>please tick this box if your model is straight
      after molecular replacements and has not been refined. The pipeline will figure out initial R-factors 
      and depending on them decide how many jelly body cycles to run to improve fit of your model (may take 
      up to several hours)</p>
      <br/>
      <h2>Advanced Options</h2>
      <img src="lorestr_i2_task_3.png">
      <p><b>Normally you don't need to change the default values.</b></p>
      <p><b>Save disk space by removing excessive ProSMART output:</b> for large structures, ProSMART output could 
      be up to a hundred or two hundred megabytes. As the pipeline runs up to ten (or more) protocols, that
      can easily go up to several GB of data per single pipeline run. By checking this box (default option is ON) 
      you ask pipeline to remove all excessive ProSMART output (detailed results of structures analysis,
      scripts for visualisation programs, etc) and leave only restraints used for refinement. If you are interested in
      reusing ProSMART analysis data, uncheck this box.
      </p>
      <p><b>Download homologues with resolution better than X:</b> a simple treshold for downloading homologues
      in the pipeline "Auto" mode. Structures with resolution lower than this treshold will be ignored for restraints 
      generation.</p>
      <p><b>Use up to X homologues for restraints: </b> maximal number of homologues for analysis. In our tests we spotted that by increasing number
      of homologues used for simultaneous restrants generation, efficiency of the refinement drops down.
      Default value delivers best performance in our tests.</p>
      <p><b>Use up to X chains to generate restraints: </b> specifies maximal number of homologous chains used for 
      restraints generation. As pipeline will generate protocols with 1, 2, ... X homologous chains per target
      chain, changing this value will change number of refinement protocols tried by the pipeline. Default
      value delivered best performance in our tests and we don't advice to change it.</p>

      <p>Average run of the Low Resolution Refinement Pipeline takes from 15 minutes to several hours depending 
      on your hardware, size of your structure and number of CPUs available for parallel execution of
      multiple refinement protocols.</p>
      <p>During the run, top bar of the Results page shows current status of the pipeline. For instance,
      on this screenshot LORESTR is analysing the data; it already determined twinning status of the data
      and is still estimating best scaling method and solvent parameters. </p>
      <br/>
      <img src="lorestr_i2_report_2.png">
      <p>Once input analysis is over and refinement protocols are generated, the pipeline starts to execute
      refinements. It can run several refinements in parallel if user specified multiple CPUs in the options.
      On this screenshot you can see typical report page in the middle of the run. First refinement protocol 
      has been finished and the table was populated with corresponding values of resulting R-factors, etc. Other 
      protocols are running, few protocols are waiting for the execution (number of CPUs was less than the
      total number of refinement protocols).</p>
      <br/>
      <img src="lorestr_i2_report_3.png">
      <p>
      After running all refinement protocols, LORESTR selects the best-performing protocol according to a quality indicator 
      that depends on both Rfree and the MolProbity score percentile (Kovalevskiy et al., 2016), or just simply 
      Rfree if MolProbity is not available from a local PHENIX installation (phenix.molprobity shall be in the $PATH for automated assesment of the
      structure quality).</p> 

      <p>The pipeline reports final statistics on all protocols as
      a scatter plot with Rfree and MolProbity score percentile on the axes. Quality of the structure before
      and after refinement is reported.</p>
