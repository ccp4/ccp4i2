<h4><a name="Resolution"></a>Estimation of resolution</h4>

<br>
<figure><img alt="Resolution statistics" src="aimless_pipe_report_8.png">
<figcaption>Figure 8: Resolution statistics</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="wide">
What is the real resolution? The good guides are (a) the correlation
coefficient between random half-datasets
CC(Ã&#8218;Â½), and (b) the average
signal/noise after averaging symmetry-related observations
&lt;&lt;I&gt;/&#963;(&lt;I&gt;)&gt;, labelled Mn(I)/sd(Mn(I)) in the Aimless
table. The default cut-off on CC(Â½) around 0.3, and on
&lt;&lt;I&gt;/&#963;(&lt;I&gt;)&gt; is ~1.3. Resolution cut-offs ought to
take
into account anisotropy of diffraction, which is not handled gracefully
by current software. Aimless analyses anisotropy in cones around 2 or 3
orthogonal principal directions (depending on the point group). The
final Summary table includes a rough estimate of the resolution in each
direction, as well as overall estimates. It is often best to integrate
the data to a higher resolution and then cut it back after examining
the Report. Note that R<sub>merge</sub> and its relatives are not
  good indicators of resolution, as they increase to arbitrary large
  values as the intensities get weaker.
</p>
<figure class="smaller"><img alt="Completeness vs. Resolution" src="aimless_pipe_report_9.png">

</figure>
<p class="wide">
Figure 8 shows three graphs against resolution which help you to
decide whether the estimated resolution limits are sensible, tabulated
in 8(d), from CC(Â½) and Mn(I)/sd(Mn(I)). 8(a) shows CC(Â½) (red
line) with a curve fit (pale blue): it also shows CCanom (green line)
which shows in this case that there is a strong anomalous signal (see
later). 8(b) shows the anisotropy, in two directions for this
tetragonal example. 8(c) shows I/&#963;I after merging (yellow) and
before (blue). Note that by default XDS integrated into the corners of
a square detector, so the highest resolution data are very incomplete
(and the completeness of the anomalous data is worse) (figure 9)
</p>
<p class="wide">
It is a mistake to cut back the resolution too severely at the data
reduction stage. It makes sense to restrict the resolution in locating
heavy-atom sub-structures, but in refinement and model building even
weak high resolution data can be helpful. Cutting back the resolution
makes your R-factors look better, but is unlikely to improve your
model.

<h4><a name="Batch"></a>Analysis against Batch, radiation damage etc</h4>
<figure class="full"><img alt="Analysis against batch" src="aimless_pipe_report_10.png">
<figcaption>Figure 10: Analysis against batch</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>
<p class="wide">
The Batch Number is the image number for the central part of a spot,
  if necessary incremented by a multiple of 1000 if you are merging multiple
  sweeps or crystals. The various analyses against Batch allow you to
  detect (a) radiation damage, causing a general decay in data quality
  with time (radiation dose) (b) individual bad parts of the data,
  single bad images or parts where something went wrong: these need
  further investigation, examining the images and the integration
  process (c) if you are merging data from multiple crystals or
  sweeps (all called Runs in AIMLESS), some may be better than others
  (see below) 
</p>

<p class="wide"> Figure 10 shows a straightforward example of radiation damage. With
  increasing radiation dose, the relative B-factor becomes more
  negative (figure 10b), so that the average scale (red in 10a)
  increases above the scale at infinite resolution (blue in
  10a). R<sub>merge</sub> tends to increase (figure 10c), and the
  estimated maximum resolution gets worse (figure 10d, roughly estimated as the
  point at which  I/&#963;I falls below 1.0). The cumulative
  completeness plot (figure 10e) shows that the second half of the
  data could be omitted without compomising completeness, and it would
  be worth trying structure solution and refinement with the truncated
data as well as the full set.</p>
<br>
<figure class="smaller"><img alt="one bad image" src="aimless_pipe_report_badimage.png">
<figcaption>Figure 11: one bad image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="wide">
Sometimes there is just a single bad image which should be excluded, as in figure 11.
</p><br>
<figure class="small"><img alt="run pair correlations" src="aimless_pipe_report_runCC.png">
<figcaption>Figure 12: run pair correlations</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="wide">With multiple crystals or sweeps, the decision on which
part(s) of the data to include is more complicated. With large numbers
of crystals, the analysis by the program BLEND may be useful. AIMLESS
does include&nbsp; two other analyses which may be useful:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A table of pairwise correlations between runs, presented as a
  table (figure 12) and a graph against resolution</li>
  <li>If you have a preliminary structure, you can give the calculated
  structure factors as a reference file  (using the Input option
  <span style="font-style: italic;">Use reference data in analysis
  against Batch after scaling</span>).
  This will plot the correlation coefficient and R-factor between the
  observed intensity and F<sub>calc</sub><sup>2</sup> as a function of
  Batch, which may help to show which parts of the data
  agree best with the model. Of course this has some danger of model
  bias, so perhaps should be used with caution.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h4><a name="Completeness"></a>Completeness and multiplicity</h4>
<p class="wide">
Datasets should be complete, as near to 100% as you can manage. Some
loss of completeness can be tolerated in the outermost resolution
bins. Dangers: watch out for bad anomalous completeness (see example
left). Note that in P1 you need a rotation of at least 180Â°+2&#952;max
(better 360Â°) to get complete anomalous data.
Note that XDS integrates into the corners of square detectors,
leading to very incomplete data at the maximum resolution. You should
apply a high resolution limit, maybe to the resolution of the
  inscribed circle. Detectors with many tiles may lose significant
  numbers of spots in the gaps between tiles, leading to serious
  incompleteness in low symmetry space groups (P1). You can complete
  the data with another dataset collected by rotation about a
  different axis (eg with a Kappa offset). You may also be able to
  recover some data by accepting "Edge" reflections flagged by MOSFLM
  (see Input->Additional options).

<h4><a name="Anomalous"></a>Detection of an anomalous signal</h4>
<figure class="threequarter"><img alt="Anomalous signal detection" src="aimless_pipe_report_anom.png">
<figcaption>Figure 13: Anomalous signal detection<br>
Top line: strong anomalous signal. Bottom line: no anomalous (native)
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="wide">
The most useful indicator of the presence of an anomalous signal is
the plot of CC(anom) (green line in the left-hand panels of figure
11). CC(anom) is the correlation between two random half-dataset
values of (I+ - I-), a similar definition to that for CC(Â½). Figure 13 top
left shows typical behaviour of a strong signal, declining with
resolution as the intensities weaken. With multiple datasets (eg MAD),
then the correlation between datasets is also plotted. The correlation
coefficient is essentially the slope of the scatter plot shown in the
central panels of figure 13 (DelAnom scatterplot), showing elongation
along the diagonal at the top, and a random pattern on the bottom. The
right-hand panels are normal probability or Q-Q plots: these have a
slope &gt; 1.0 if the differences are greater than would be expected from
their estimated errors. For the location of the anomalous
sub-structure, you might want to restrict the resolution to the point
where CC(anom) drops below about 0.3, then use the full resolution
range for phasing. Even a weak or undetectable anomalous signal may be
useful for locating anomalous scatterers in difference Fouriers once
you have phases (or better in log-likelihood gradient maps).

<h4><a name="SDs"></a>Analysis of Standard Deviations</h4>
<figure class="small"><img alt="SD correction plot" src="aimless_pipe_report_SDplot.png">
<figcaption>Figure 14: SD correction plot</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="wide">
AIMLESS compares the observed scatter of symmetry-related observations
around the mean with the estimated &#963;(I), and "corrects" the &#963;(I) by a
multiplier and a function of &lt;I&gt;. On average, the observed scatter
should equal the estimated standard deviation.</p>
<p class="wide">
<span class="equation">&#963;'2(I) = SdFac2 {&#963;2(I)+ SdB
  &lt;Ih&gt; + (SdAdd &lt;Ih&gt;)2}</span>
</p>
<p class="wide">
where &lt;Ih&gt; is the average intensity of reflection h.
By default, the three parameters SdFac, SdB &amp; SdAdd are determined
automatically, with separate values for fulls &amp; partials, and for each
run. The plot in figure 14 represents the distribution of normalised
errors&nbsp;<span class="equation">&#948; =
  (I-&lt;Ih&gt;)/&#963;(I)</span> as a function of &lt;Ih&gt;. This
  distribution 
should have a standard deviation of 1.0, so the plot should be
horizontal with a value = 1.0 everywhere. If it slopes upwards, then
&#963;(I) is too small for large I, so SdAdd should be increased, or
reduced if it slopes downwards. The example in figure 14 is OK but not
  particularly good, but if these plots vary too much from 1.0 then
  some parameters can be changed in the input, in Additional
  Options-&gt;override default parameters for each run. Useful options
  are (a) making the the parameters the same or similar (ie
  restrained equal) for all runs, and (b) fixing the sdB parameter to 0.0.

<h4><a name="Statistics"></a>Statistics</h4>
<p class="wide">
<em>Measures of self-consistency:</em> these are R-factor or
  correlation coefficient statistics which compare symmetry-related or
replacate measurements. They are used in analyses against resolution
and against batch, as described above.

<br>Precision-indicating R-factor, more closely related to precision of
  the merged intensity   </li>
  <li>Correlation coefficients, such as CC(½)
  <br>These have the advantage of well-defined statistical properties
  (0 no correlation, +1 perfect correlation), unlike R-factors</li>
</ol>
<p class="wide">
 Note that some authorities use a slightly different definition of
R<sub>merge</sub> and its relatives, with 
<span class="equation"> &#8721;&#8721;I<sub>hl</sub></span>
as the denominator instead of
<span class="equation"> &#8721;&#8721;&lt;I<sub>h</sub>&gt;</span>.
These are likely to have very similar values in most cases.
