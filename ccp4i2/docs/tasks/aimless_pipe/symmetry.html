The indexing of the
lattice in an integration program (such as Mosflm) is based on the
lattice geometry, with no regard for the symmetry of the diffraction
pattern, which can only be determined after integration. The default
option scores potential symmetry operators in the diffraction pattern,
and ranks the possible rotational groups (Laue groups or point groups<a href="symmetry.html#fn1" name="ref1"></a><a href="symmetry.html#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>),
and also inspects axial reflections for possible systematic absences
which may indicate a likely space group. Be careful, the presence of
pseudo-symmetry may suggest a higher symmetry than the truth. POINTLESS
tries to allow for this possibility, but inspection of the scores for
individual symmetry elements may help to indicate the correct space
group in difficult cases. Weak high resolution
data does not contain reliable
information for the determination of rotational symmetry (the Laue or
point group, so POINTLESS may cut the resolution just for this
	purpose. If possible it cuts the data at the point where 
CC(½) falls below 0.6 (calculated using only the Friedel symmetry (ie in P1)), or
I/&#963;(I)&gt;6
if there are insufficent data to calculate CC(½).</p>

</h4>
<p class="wide"><em>Scoring individual symmetry elements. </em>Each possible symmetry operator in the lattice is scored separately, by a pairwise correlation coefficient (CC) between E<sup>2</sup> for observations related by that operator, and also by an R-factor, R<sub>meas</sub>.
The CC is used to estimate a probability, allowing for possible small
samples by comparing it with the distribution CCs of equal sized
samples of unrelated observation pairs. This separate scoring is useful
in cases of pseudo-symmetry to indicate the true symmetry, in cases
where the program gets it wrong. In the example in figure 3, the true
symmetry is C222, but because of the accidental combination of cell
lengths, b &#8776; &#8730;3 a, the lattice can be indexed as hexagonal. The scores
show that three orthogonal dyads are present, but the other potential
operators of the hexagonal lattice are absent.&nbsp;</p>

</figure>
<p class="wide"><em>Scoring Laue groups.</em> The scores from the individual
elements are then combined into a joint score for all possible Laue
groups which are subgroups of the lattice group. A high score for a
symmetry element which is present in the lattice group but not in the
Laue group will count against that group (the CC-, Zc- and R- columns
in the table). Note that in Figure 4 the pseudo-hexagonal lattice
can accommodate three possible Cmmm settings, 60° apart: the one chosen
randomly (ReindexOperator [h,k,l]) by the original indexing was wrong
here.</p>

<p class="wide">
<em>Systematic absence scores.</em> Within a chosen Laue group, space groups
(all chiral groups apart from the pairs I222 and 
I2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>, and I23 and
I2<sub>1</sub>3) may be distinguished by the presence or absence of screw axes
along the cell edges. A screw axis leads to systematic absences along
an axis of the reciprocal lattice eg a 2<sub>1</sub> screw along <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span> in space group
P2<sub>1</sub> makes axial reflections 0k0 present only when k is even. Detecting
systematic absences may be unreliable because the axial reflections may
be few in number (as along the <span style="font-style: italic;">a</span> axis in figure 5),
or missing from the dataset if they lie along the
spindle rotation axis in the data collection (in the blind region), or
may be misleading if there are approximate non-crystallographic screw
axes, but in many cases they can suggest the space group, to be
confirmed later: the space group remains a hypothesis until the
structure is satisfactorily solved. In POINTLESS, a Fourier analysis is
used to detect periodicity, on I'/&#963;: the intensity I' used here is
adjusted by subtraction of a small fraction (default 0.02) of the
intensity of the neighbouring reflection along the axis, to allow for
possible overlap of a nearby strong reflection (figure 5).

<p class="wide">
<em>Choice of space group or point group.</em> Possible space
groups are ranked according to their total probability = Laue group
probability × Systematic absence probability. If there is a unique
solution with the highest total probability, this will be chosen as a
"space group" solution. If some of the potential systematic
absence data is missing, then more than
one space group has the same score, and the point group will be chosen,
in this case P 4 2 2. Enantiomorphic space groups will have the same
score, so the first one is chosen as a space group solution  (see figure 6). As well as
the scores, a "confidence" score is calculated for both the Laue group
and the space group, defined as &#8730;[Score × (Score - NextBestScore)]:
these values are printed in a summary table as the Best Solution. If you prefer a different solution to that chosen by the
program, you can rerun the program with the Choose a previous solution
option.<br>

<h4><a name="match_index"></a>2. Match index to reference<br>
</h4>
<figure class="small"><img alt="alternative indexing scores"

<figcaption>Figure 7: alternative indexing scores</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="wide">
In some point-groups there are more than one (typically two or four)
valid but non-equivalent indexing possibilities. For your first
crystal, you may choose any of these, but subsequent crystals must
match the first. This problem generally arises in cases where the point
group symmetry is less than the lattice symmetry: the alternative
indexing schemes are related by the symmetry operators present in the
lattice but not in the point group. These are the same point groups
which may lead to merohedral twinning, eg point group P3 has four
possible indexing schemes in the lattice point-group P622 (f<a href="http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/html/reindexing.html">urther explanation</a>).
Within multiple datasets from the same crystal (eg MAD), you can avoid
this problem by only autoindexing one set, &amp; using the same
indexing matrix for the others, but different crystals must be
explicitly checked for consistent indexing. Reindexing ambiguities may
also arise in lower-symmetry point-groups in case of accidental
coincidences or relationships between cell dimensions (eg a &#8776; b in
orthorhombic or the pseudo-hexagonal C222 example in figure 3).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="wide">A ranked table of scores for each possible indexing
scheme is printed. The example in figure 7 is unusually complicated:
the true space group is rhombohedral, R3, but the lattice is
pseudo-cubic; in the rhombohedral axis system (with a = b = c, &#945; = &#946; =
&#947;) the angles are close to 90°. This means that in addition to the
usual ambiguity in R3 with alternative indexing [k,h,-l] (in the
hexagonal setting aka H3) , there are four possible directions for true
3-fold axis, along the body-diagonals of the cubic lattice, leading to
a total of eight possible indexing schemes. <br>

<h4><a name="choose_known_solution"></a>3. Choose known or previous solution</h4>
<p class="wide">

This option allows an explicit choice of indexing or symmetry. The
Choose solution from search options perform the usual search, but
selects the given solution even if it does not have the highest score.
The Specify Laue group name or Specify space group name use the given
groups without doing the searches, ie the program just changes the
group, with an option to reindex.<br>

<br>
</p>
<h4><a name="just_copy"></a>4. No symmetry testing just copy and combine input files</h4>
<p class="wide">This option just sorts one or more input files, usually because there are more than one, and you know the space group.<br>
