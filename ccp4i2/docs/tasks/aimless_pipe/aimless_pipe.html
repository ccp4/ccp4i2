    The Data Reduction task takes reflection intensities from an
integration program such as Mosflm, XDS or DIALS, and converts them to
scaled merged intensities and structure amplitudes. This consists of a
number of stages
<br/><br/>
<ol>
  <li>&#8226; Read one or more input files,&nbsp; combining them and
putting them on a consistent indexing scheme if necessary (program
POINTLESS)</li>
  <li>&#8226; Determine the crystal symmetry, ie the Laue group and if possible
the space group, by inspecting the internal symmetry of the intensities
(program POINTLESS)</li>
  <li>&#8226; Scale together symmetry-related reflections (program AIMLESS)</li>
  <li>&#8226; Examine the intensity statistics to detect twinning, and generate amplitudes (F) from intensities (I) (program CTRUNCATE)</li>
  <li>&#8226; Generate or extend a set of FreeR reflections for later use in refinement
  </li>
</ol>
<br/><br/>
Detailed documentation for individual programs is available here: <a href="http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/dist/html/pointless.html">POINTLESS</a>, <a href="http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/dist/html/aimless.html">AIMLESS</a>, <a href="http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/dist/html/ctruncate.html">CTRUNCATE</a>
    <h2>Input</h2>
    <figure><img src="aimless_pipe_task_1.png"><figcaption> Figure 1: Main input</figcaption></figure>
    <h3>Reflection input</h3>
    <p>Input
reflection files are specified here, either from earlier jobs, or from
outside the GUI. They should contain unmerged reflections, ie the
output from an integration program <b class="img-ref">(1.1)</b>
Click "Show list" to allow input of multiple files. File formats
recognised are: unmerged MTZ, from Mosflm or DIALS; files from XDS,
XDS_ASCII.HKL (scaled) or INTEGRATE.HKL (unscaled); .raw files from
SAINT (Bruker); Scalepack files (.sca); and ShelX files. The last two
cannot be properly scaled by AIMLESS as they lack diffraction geometry
information. </p>
    
    <p>Each file must be identified by a crystal name and dataset name:
these should be short and not include spaces, and must be set here if
they haven't been set by the integration program. <b class="img-ref">(1.2) </b>They
are used to identify the dataset in later structure solution tasks (as
/crystal/dataset/). Files with the same dataset name will be merged
into a single output dataset: different dataset names (eg for MAD data)
will lead to multiple output sets. Parts of the data may be omitted
either by specifying batch ranges for exclusion <b class="img-ref">(</b><b class="img-ref">1.</b><b class="img-ref">3)</b>, or by setting resolution limits <b class="img-ref">(</b><b class="img-ref">1.</b><b class="img-ref">4)</b>.
Typically you would do that after running the task first and inspecting
the output. It is often useful to integrate the images to slightly
higher resolution than you think the pattern extends to, then cut back
the resolution following a first run of Aimless. And parts of the data
showing serious radiation damage may be omitted, provided that
completeness is not compromised.&nbsp; </p>    
    <p>The default option is to try to determine the Laue group (the
rotational point group), and if possible the space group. However if
you know the space group you can specify it explicitly, selecting the
option from the pull-down menu <b class="img-ref">(</b><b class="img-ref">1.</b><b class="img-ref">5)</b>. The space group may also be set by giving a reference file with the correct space group <b class="img-ref">(</b><b class="img-ref">1.</b><b class="img-ref">6)</b>.
The reference file is also used to resolve indexing ambiguities in
space groups where there are non-equivalent but valid alternative
indexings (the same cases where merohedral or pseudo-merohedral
twinning is possible). The reference file may be a previous isomorphous
dataset (intensities or Fs), or atomic coordinates from which structure
factors are calculated. If multiple input files are given, then if
necessary they will be checked for consistent indexing, against the
reference data if given, or against the first file. </p>


<p>The last item on this page can be used to specify a pre-existing FreeR set
for adoption and extension, provided it is compatible. If this is not
given a new FreeR set is generated, but you should use the same set for
all isomorphous datasets in a project <b class="img-ref">(</b><b class="img-ref">1.</b><b class="img-ref">7)</b></p>

<h2>Options</h2>
    <figure><img src="aimless_pipe_task_2.png">
	    <figcaption> Figure 2: Important options </figcaption></figure>
    
    <p>This page (and the next one) set various options which are not usually required. The first pull-down <b class="img-ref">(2.1)</b>
allows you to override the default of IUCr standard settings for
primitive orthorhombic and centred monoclinic spacegroups: this
convention sets a&lt;b&lt;c for all primitive orthorhombic, eg it
allows P 2<sub>1</sub> 2 2<sub>1</sub> rather than the "reference" setting P 2<sub>1</sub> 2<sub>1</sub>
2, and also chooses the alternative I2 in place of C2 if it gives a
smaller &#946; angle. The default is recommended. The second
pull-down <b class="img-ref">(2.2)</b> allows more detailed
specification of the scaling model: options other than the default
open additional panes (see eg <b class="img-ref">(3.4)</b>) to set the
interval on crystal rotation angle Phi for the scaling. You can also
change the criteria for outlier rejection 
<b class="img-ref">(3.5)</b>, and define 'Runs' explicitly by batch range
<b class="img-ref">(3.6)</b>, to override the automatic setting.<br/> 
    </p>
    <figure><img src="aimless_pipe_task_3.png">

<h3>Additional options</h3>
    <p>The third pane offers further
options, again ones you will not normally need to change. The most
useful is probably the option to change parameters for the optimisation
of the estimated sigma(I) (see Results page) <b class="img-ref">(4.8)</b> 
The pull-down allows you to have the same "correction" factors for all
runs, which may be more suitable than the default if you have many
short runs. The refinement may also be stabilised if needed by fixing
the sdB parameters.
</p><p>The <i>Selection of intensities</i> panel <b class="img-ref">(4.7)</b>
offers the option to accept overloaded observations, ie those where
the detector was saturated in the centre of the spot, but it was still
possible to get an estimate of the intensity by profile-fitting the
spot edges, even though these estimates will be relatively
inaccurate. Accepting these observations may allow you to rescue
datasets when too many strong low resolution spots were
saturated. This is unlikely to be a problem with 
fine-sliced pixel detector data.
</p><p>The option to <i>accept observations on the edge of the tile or
detector</i> <b class="img-ref">(4.7)</b> may be used to increase the
completeness of a dataset collected on a tiled detector, where a
significant number of spots fall into the gaps between tiles. This is
a problem in low symmetry space groups such as P1.

	  The output from this task is quite detailed, and some of it is
only relevant if there are problems. You can drill down to the details
of the process, much of presented as graphs. Based on the output, you
need to make some judgements about your data. <br/><br/>
&#8226; What is the real resolution? Should you cut the high-resolution data?<br/>
&#8226; Are there bad batches (individual bad batches or ranges of batches)?<br/>
&#8226; Was the radiation damage such that you should exclude the later parts?<br/>
&#8226; Is there any apparent anomalous signal?<br/>

<p>
The report is divided into sections, and clicking in the top line 
<b class="img-ref">(1.1)</b> will jump to the selected part of the
report. The first section <b class="img-ref">(1.2)</b> summarises the
main conclusions from the task: (a) choice of space group, and the
confidence in this choice; (b) key statistics from merging, merging
R-factors, I/sigma(I), CC(1/2) etc; (c) any indications of
translational NCS or twinning.

<h3>Overall summary</h3>
  <div>
    <figure><img src="aimless_pipe_report_2.png">
	    <figcaption> Figure 2: Main summary</figcaption></figure>
 
<p>The Key summary is followed by the Overall summary tables and graphs. Panel 
<b class="img-ref">(2.1)</b> shows more detail of the space group
determination. It may be worth looking a finer details later in the
report, particularly if the confidence is low.
Panel <b class="img-ref">(2.2)</b> is the classic "Table 1" suitable
(more or less) for inclusion in a publication. The "Download" button
writes this table as a CSV file which can be imported into word
processing programs. 
Panel <b class="img-ref">(2.3)</b> shows the L-test for twinning.
Panel <b class="img-ref">(2.4)</b> shows the main graphs of statistics
against resolution, which illustrate where a resolution cutoff might
be applied, and also whether a significant anomalous signal is
present.
The example shown has strong data to the edge of collection (red line
of CC(1/2) values), and a strong anomalous signal extending over much of
the resolution range. Note that placing the mouse over the graphs
brings up a brief description (yellow box). Other graphs can by
accessed from the pull-down menu at the top, and a seperate graph
window can be created using the arrow icon at the top right (this
gives access to all graphs from the task).
Panel <b class="img-ref">(2.5)</b> shows graphs against "Batch
number", ie image number within each Run or sweep of data. These
graphs can be used to assess whether later parts of the data are
suffer from serious radiation damage, and whether they may be omitted
without losing too much completeness.
