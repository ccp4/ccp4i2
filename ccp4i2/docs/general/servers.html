<a name="introduction"/><h3>Introduction</h3>
<img src="./runremote.png" alt="Server gui" style="float:left">
<p>CCP4i2 usually runs jobs on the user's computer but can also send
jobs to a server. The CCP4i2 installation must first be configured to
know about the available servers (this should usually be done by
whoever installs CCP4i2) and then a 'Run on server' option will appear
in the <i>Project Viewer</i> toolbar.
When you click this option you
will see a window with, at the top, a selection from one or more
groups of servers and then a pull-down menu to choose the server
machine. CCP4i2 needs to know the installation directory for CCP4 on
the server machine but this is usually already provided and you then
need to enter your user name and password on the server.
You will not need to enter any of these details again in
this CCP4i2 session. The password is not saved anywhere.</p>
<p>CCP4i2 polls the remote running job at regular intervals to
retrieve the current status and data to display in the 'running' report and to
check if the job has finished. You can check if a server job is still
running using the <i>Running jobs and processes</i> option on the
<i>Utilities</i> menu. This will list the jobs running on your local
machine and any server that you are using. For each job it should list
a 'ccp4i2' process that is the controlling process and one or more
child processes that are the running programs.</p>

<a name="mechanisms"/><h3>Overview of mechanism</h3>
<p>CCP4i2 uses different mechanisms to run jobs on servers dependent on
whether or not the client and server machines share a file
system and whether they support job queues. All current mechanisms
assume that the servers are running Linux.</p>
<p>Where server and client are part of a Linux cluster they are
often set up with a shared filesystem and there is no need to transfer files
to and from the server.  If there is not a shared file system
(certainly the case if the client is a Mac or Windows PC) then files must be
copied and this is done by creating and copying a <i>'jobball'</i> which is a zip file
containing a small fraction of the users project directory with the
directory structure of the project directory and just the necessary
files to run the job. When the job has finished on the server another
<i>jobball</i>, now containing the output files, is created and
returned.</p>
<p>Running on a server uses a temporary database local to the server. This is true even if there
is a shared file system - it is necessary to avoid potential issues with the database
locking mechanism over NFS file systems. So, when running a server job
a small fragment of the database is exported (as an XML file) and
copied to the server where it is used to initialise the temporary
database. When the job finishes the temporary database will contain
information on the jobs run and files created and this is exported as
XML and returned to the client machine to be reintegrated into the
user's database.<p> 
<p>CCP4i2 uses the <i>paramiko</i> Python library (distributed with
CCP4) which provides <i>ssh</i> functionality on all platforms.
CCP4i2 currently supports these alternative mechanisms for running
on a server:
<br/><b>Using <i>ssh</i> without a shared file system.</b> This mechanism
should work for any Linux server and any Linux, Mac or Windows
client. It does not require any additional software installation. It
will copy a <i>jobball</i> to and from the server using an
implementation of <i>scp</i>.
<br/><b>Using <i>ssh</i> with a shared file system</b> Will work if the
client machine is part of the same Linux cluster as the server and
the machines see the same filesystem with the same pathnames. This
does not require copying potentially large files and is to be
preferred if possible.
<br/><b>Using <i>qsub</i> queuing system</b> This
requires that <i>qsub</i> is installed but has the
benefit of providing scheduling of jobs which may be advantageous for
large jobs.  CCP4i2 has been tested against .  If you try against
an alternative version we will be grateful for your feedback.</p>
<p>The Grid Engine system supports the idea of submit hosts (from
which a job can be submitted) and execution hosts (on which the job is
run) and this will be set up by your system manager.  Ideally your
working machine should be a submit host so CCP4i2 can just submit a
job on your working machine and the Grid Engine deals with
communication to an execution host.  If your working machine is not
a submit host then CCP4i2 can be configured to use <b>qsub on another
machine</b> or <b>qsub with shared file system</b> where CCP4i2 uses
ssh tools to copy files and submit a qsub job on another machine.</p>

<a name="configure"/><h3>Configuring running on a server</h3>
<p>The <i>Configure servers</i> option can be found as part of the <i>Utilities</i> menu option for
<i>System administrator tools</i>. The setup can be for an individual
user (saved in their home directory
<i>.CCP4I2/configs/serverSetup.params.xml</i>) or for all users of the
CCP4i2 installation (saved in
<i>ccp4/shared/ccp4i2/local_setup/serverSetup.params.xml</i>).</p>
<img src="./serverSetup.png" alt="Server gui" style="float:left">
<p>At the
top of the <i>Configure servers</i> window it tells you the current context
and has the option to load the
alternative file if it is present.</p>
<p>You can configure one or more groups of servers. A group of servers
have similar properties. For each server group you should enter a name
and choose the mechanism (see <a href="#mechanisms">Overview of
mechanisms</a> above).
You can then enter a list of available server machines (note: use the
+/- below the list to add/remove lines in the list, enter the server
address in the text entry box below the list).
If you want to allow users to add server addresses then check the next
box.
You need to provide the directory path for the CCP4 installation on
the server machine - the user can enter or edit this a run time but it
is preferable that they do not need to. If the mechanism does not
use a shared file system then you must provide a directory path for
temporary files. If the path includes the user name (which will be
entered by the user at run time) this should be entered as '$USER'.
<p> There is an option for each
server group to
<i>Test server group</i>. For each machine in the server group it
will make an ssh connection and test the existance of the CCP4
installation directory and the temporary directory. You will be
required to provide an login name and password for the server machines.
</p>
<p>The <i>qsub</i> queuing mechanism has many options (see <a
href="http://gridscheduler.sourceforge.net/htmlman/htmlman1/qsub.html">documentation</a>). Options
can be placed in a file and if an option file exists then CCP4i2 will
invoke it when using <i>qsub</i>.  The option file can be either
</br> <i>$CCP4/share/ccp4i2/local_setup/qsub_options</i> applied for all users of
the CCP4 installation or
</br> <i>$HOME/.CCP4I2/configs/qsub_options</i> for a single user.
</p>
</p>At the bottom of the
window, the parameters can be saved for either user or installation;
if the user does not have write permission for the installation
this option will not be presented. 
<p>Computer setups and requirements are very variable - if the above
mechanisms are not ideal for you please contact CCP4 describing your
setup and preferred mechanism for using servers.</p>
<a name="programatic"/><h3>Running jobs on a server from scripts</h3>
<p>The <i>Job controller</i> in CCP4i2 controls the running of jobs
either on the local machine or a server machine.  Within the CCP4i2
gui the <i>Job
controller</i> works by polling the database for
jobs that have been tagged as waiting to run. To run a job on a server
(rather than locally) the server parameters described
above must previously have been
set for the <i>jobId</i> in the <i>Job controller</i>.</p>
<p>The server parameters are held by the
<i>CCP4JobController.CServerParams</i> class which presently is just:
<pre>
class CServerParams:
  def __init__(self,**kw):
    self.machine =  kw.get('machine',None)
    self.username =  kw.get('username',None)
    self.password =  kw.get('password',None)
    self.ccp4Dir =  kw.get('ccp4Dir',None)
    self.tempDir = kw.get('tempDir',None)
    self.mechanism = kw.get('mechanism',None)
</pre>
<p>These parameters can be set in the <i>Job controller</i> and the
job started by:</p>
<pre>
  from qtcore import CCP4JobController
  from core import CCP4Modules
  params =CCP4JobController.CServerParams(machine='xxx.xxx.xxx',ccp4Dir='/y/xtal/ccp4',
     mechanism='ssh_shared',username='me',password='secret')
  CCP4Modules.JOBCONTROLLER().setServerParams(jobId,params)
  CCP4Modules.JOBCONTROLLER().runOnServer(jobId)
</pre>
<p>The <i>jobId</i> is a Python string representation of the
databases uuid (universal unique identifier).</p>
