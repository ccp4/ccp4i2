<h1>CCP4i2 Installation for Testers</h1>

<p>The present mechanism for installing CCP4i2 relies on having a recent CCP4mg installed and the libraries in CCP4mg being used by i2. The Python and other (mostly) uncompiled stuff is accessed via the source control at CCPForge. The advantage of this is that it should be possible to get updates quickly and easily. The disadvantage is that you are at the bleeding edge and may see some (very temporary) bugs.</p>

<h3>Using CCPForge to Access CCP4i2 Code</h3>
<p>You need to register with CCPForge and join the CCP4i2 project.  To do that:
<ul>
  <li>Go to <a href="http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk">ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk</a></li>
  <li>Click <b>Register New Account</b> (currently top right of home page). </li>
  <li>Fill in form, submit and wait for email response</li>
  <li>Once you are registered login in and go to the CCP4i2 page. (Currently this is click on the <b>Projects</b> tab at the top of the CCP4Forge home page and then scroll down and go onto the <b>Next page</b> and you should see CCP4i2 listed). On the CCP4i2 page there is a <b>Request to Join Project</b> button on the right hand side.</li>
  <li>After your request I will have to reply by email to confirm OK so there may be some delay</li>
</ul>
<p>To access the SVN you will need the environment variables set:
<pre>
SVN_EDITOR=vi
svnroot=http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/svn/ccp4i2
</pre>
<p>Then the command</p>
<pre>
 svn co $svnroot
</pre>
<p>should do the trick. After this you should update your installation by going into the ccp4i2 directory and typing the command:</p>
<pre>
svn update
</pre>
<p>If you get any odd behaviour with this try typing before retrying</p>
<pre>
svn cleanup
</pre>
<p>If the update stops to warn you of conflicts then accept 'their' version (that will be my updated version). The ccpforge site is usually pretty reliable but may occasionally be down.</p> 

<p>The checked out project is all Python or uncompiled files (so no building required!). You also need to have installed a recent nightly build of CCP4mg - this is used by i2 to display results but also provides the Qt and other libraries for CCP4i2.  This can be got from:
<br/><a href="http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~ccp4mg/nightly/">http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~ccp4mg/nightly/</a>
<br/>If you are running on Linux you will need to edit the file <i>ccp4i2/bin/browser</i> to set the path to CCP4MG (search the file for 'CCP4MG'). If you are running on MacOSX and have installed CCP4mg in the default /Applications this should not be necessary. You will also need to setup an up-to-date version of the CCP4 suite before starting CCP4i2 with the command:<p>
<pre>
ccp4i2/bin/browser
</pre>


<h3>For Developers Only</h3>
<p>Developers may find the file <i>ccp4i2/utils/setup.sh</i> useful to set up a developer environment. This will need some intelligent editing for your system. I source this file in my .bashrc.</p>

<h3>Other Programs</h3>
<p>CCP4i2 currently may launch CCP4mg,Coot or viewhkl.  These can be downloaded from:</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Coot</td><td>Linux</td><td><a href="http://lmb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/coot/software/binaries/releases/"> http://lmb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/coot/software/binaries/releases/</a></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>Mac</td><td><a href="http://sage.ucsc.edu/~wgscott/xtal/wiki/index.php/Stand-Alone_Coot"> http://sage.ucsc.edu/~wgscott/xtal/wiki/index.php/Stand-Alone_Coot</a></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td> Windows</td><td><a href="http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~lohkamp/coot/wincoot.html">  http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~lohkamp/coot/wincoot.html</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>hklview</td><td>All</td><td></td></tr>
</table>
<p>CCP4i2 needs to know the path of the executable for each package. This is set in the config file which is (in Linux speak):
<br/> $HOME/.CCP4I2/configs/ccp4i2_config.params.xml
<p>This is an XMl file with a <b>searchPath</b> element with sub-elements that look like:</p>
<pre>    
      &lt;ccp4mg>
         &lt;macosx>
           &lt;path>/Applications/QtMG.app/Contents/ccp4mg*/bin/ccp4mg &lt;/path>
           &lt;path>/usr/local/ccp4mg*/bin/ccp4mg &lt;/path>
         &lt;/macosx>
         &lt;linux>
            ....
         &lt;windows>
            .....
       &lt;/ccp4mg>
</pre>
<p>For each program and each OS there is one or more <b>path</b> elements. These may include '*' characters to wildcard features such as version numbers. I2 will test these in order take the first file that exisits. If a wildcard results in two or more hits then the one with the latest modification date is used.  You may need to edit this file (though should have default install paths set for Mac and Windows).</p>
<p>If your config file does not contain the <b>searchPath</b> element delete the file and rerun CCP4i2 browser.</p>
