<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>There are several tools to enable users to customise CCP4i2:
<br/><a href="#workflows"><b>Workflows</b></a> allow you to save and rerun a series of tasks
<br/><a href="#com_file_patchs"><b>Task parameters and patches</b></a> are used to save and restore task control parameters and/or to edit command files in order to access program features not available in the interface
<br/><a href="#custom_tasks"><b>Custom tasks</b></a> allow you to run programs not supported by the interface - you must provide a command line and command files 
</p>
<p>These customisations can be set up and managed from the <i>Customisation</i> pull-down menu.  Each customisation has a manager window with options to create, edit and delete. Each customisation can be exported (as a compressed file) or imported so it is possible to share with colleagues.</p>
<p>The various customisations are saved in  <a href="./tutorial.html#profile"><i>your profile directory</a>/custom</i> in the appropriate directory: <i>workflows</i>, <i>comfilepatchs</i>, <i>tasks</i> or <i>importedjobs</i>. Each customisation has its own directory which is given the customisation name that you provide and the contents of this directory will depend on the type of customisation.</i>

<a name="workflows"/><h3>Workflows</h3>
<p>Workflows are a mechanism for users to save a series of tasks that they use frequently and rerun them as one task. The new workflow will have an auto-generated user interface to select the minimal input data. The user's preferred control parameters from the template tasks are saved and reused in each run of the workflow.</p>

<p>To create a workflow you should run the series of tasks that you want to encapsulate as a workflow. Be particularly careful about what output data from one task is chosen as input for another task because the workflow manager will automatically copy the same data flow in the generated workflow. When the tasks have run and completed successfully choose <i>Workflows</i> from the </Customisation</i> pull-down menu and select <i>New</i> in the Workflow Manager window.  In the next window you will have to select the project and the template jobs and provide a unique name for the workflow. The workflow manager will then analyse the template jobs and saves the workflow  in a directory: <a href="./projects.html#profile"><i>your profile directory</a>/custom/workflows/workflow name</i>. You are then presented with window with options to customise the interface to the workflow.  The same window can be recalled by clicking the <i>Edit</i> button in the Workflow Manager window.  The options are:
<br/><i>Short title for workflow task</i> - enter the text that will appear in the task menu and the project viewer.
</br/><i>Labels for input files</i> - This is a list of the input data files required by the workflow - check that it matches with your expectation. By default the input gui will have labels appropriate for the file type but you can change these to give specific hints if necessary.
<br/><i>Select overall workflow output files</i> - This is a list of files output by all of the tasks in the workflow and by checking the boxes you can control which files are displayed in the project viewer as the overall output of the workflow. By default the output files of the last task are the overall output files.  For each file you can also enter a short description that will appear in the project viewer.
</p>
<p>The workflows that are present in the directory <a href="./projects.html#profile"><i>your profile directory</a>/custom/workflows</i> are listed at the top of the task menu and clicking on one of this will bring up a task interface for the required input files. There is a second tab on the interface, <i>Control parameters for sub-tasks</i> and under this is a list of the sub-tasks which can be clicked to open a window with an interface to edit the control parameters of the task.</p>

<p>Workflows work well where there is input and output of just one coordinate file but some known limitations..
<br/>If there is output of more than one cordinate file (or any other type of file) then only the first file will be used in subsequent tasks.
<br/>Tasks which require addidional input (eg Phaser requiring Identity/RMS data for each input ensemble) do not work in a workflow.
</p>

<a name="com_file_patchs"><h3>Task Parameters and Patches</h3>
<p>This is a tool to do one or both of two things:
<br/>Save the control parameters used in one job so they can be restored and used in another job with one click
<br/>Edit a program command file and save the changes to apply to the command file for subsequent runs of the program.  This could be useful to access program functionality not currently interfaced by CCP4i2 or possibly to set multiple parameters with one-click rather than editing multiple options in the interface.</p>
<p>To use this tool you should first run the program in question from CCP4i2 in order to create a template command file that can be edited later. If the job is long-running and not useful you can kill it without loosing the command file. From the <i>Customisation</i> pull-down choose <i>Task parameters and patches</i> and click the <i>New</i> option. In the <i>Task Parameter and Patches Manager</i> window you should first choose the project and job that will provide the parameters and the template command file.  You should check/uncheck the option to save the task control parameters and then edit the template command file is necessary. This command file patch tool uses an approach similar to the <i>Unix diff</i> and <i>patch</i> tools that are described at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">Wikipedia</a>; these will probably work best if you make the changes as simple as possible - ideally as additional lines at the end of the file. You should enter a name and title (to appear on the interface task menu) for the patch before saving it.</p>
<p>When there are task parameters and patches available for a task then will be listed in the interface for that task at the bottom of the <i>Input data</i> tab. Selected task parameters will be applied immediately to the parameters in the interface.Selected patch will be applied to the command file when the task is run.  You might want to check that the resultant command file is correct by viewing it in the <i>Project directory</i> on the left-hand side of the Project Viewer window; the command file is in the appropriate job directory and normally called <i>com.txt</i>.</p>

<a name="custom_tasks"><h3>Custom Tasks</h3>
<p>This is a mechanism for you to run non-CCP4 programs from CCP4i2 with a simple interface, similar to the standard CCP4i2 task interfaces, enabling users to select input data and set important parameters. The custom task jobs with their input and output data are recorded in the database and shown in the project viewer the same as any other job. To set up a custom task you must provide the text of a command line to run a program and also, if it is used, the text of a command file. The text can include variables (such as input file names) as parameter names. You must then provide more information on each variable parameter - the data type (such as file type) is essential. Based on the information provided, a simple interface is auto-generated for the user to input the variables such as input file names.<p>
<p>The <i>Custom task</i> interface to set up a custom task is accessed from the <i>Customisation</i> menu. The interface to enter a new custom task has two main sections - one to enter the command line and, optionally, command file text and below that a section to define the variable parameters that appear in the command line or file.  You should first enter the command line with variable names beginning with a hash tag - something like:
<br/><i>myprogram #HKLIN #PDBIN -ncycles #NCYCLES</i>
<br>Here the program <i>myprogram</i> has command line parameters: HKLIN - an MTZ experimental data file, PDBIN - structure coordinates and NCYCLES - the number of cycles. The parameter name begins with a hash tag though and alternative tag can be specified at te top of the interface.  The command file text can be entered in similar style. By default when the custom task is run a command file will be written to the task's working directory and will be called <i>com.txt</i>.  It is also possible to specify the name of the command file if the program expects files with a specific name.<p>
<p>After entering the command line/file text click the <i>Update parameters</i> button to fill out the parameters section with the parameters from the command line/file section. For each parameter you will need to choose:</p>
<ul>
<li>a label that will appear in the interface - this is optional and defaults to the usual label for the data type</li>
<li>the data type (i.e. probably the type of file)</li>
<li>function (input,output..).</li>
<li>if the parameter is obligatory (check box)</li>
<li>if the parameter is recorded in the database (check box)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to set the 'Record in database' option correctly. Usually coordinate models and experimental data such as new phases should be recorded in the database so the flow of data can be followed and output data can be passed on to subsequent programs. Other data such as log files or program-specific 'library' files or program control parameters should not be recorded in the database but they are still saved in parameter files.</p>
<p>For parameters that are files there is an optional field to enter a file name. This name is relative to the work directory where the job is run. This filename only needs to be entered if the program requires an input file with a specific name (in which case the  user-selected file input file will be copied to that filename) or produces an output file whose filename is not specified in the command line or command file (in which case the file will be copied from the filename to a CCP4i2 standard filename). For the output files the filename can be a filename wildcard (a.k.a. 'pathname expansion' or 'glob') which can include a '*' to match any character string. There are further wildcard options described <a href="#pathname_expansions">here</a>.</p>
<p>The most difficult issue may be handling <a href="./data_files.html#MTZ">mini-MTZs</a>: CCP4i2 handles experimental data as separate observed data, phases, FreeR flags or map coefficients but presently most programs expect input with these combined to a single MTZ. The way to handle this for custom tasks is to have the single input MTZ parameter in the command text and this has the data type <i>CMtzDataFile</i>. You then create additional parameters in the parameter list with one parameter for each mini-MTZ that constitutes the monster-MTZ. (To add a parameter to the parameter table click the '+' symbol by the parameter table.) The extra parameter should be assigned a mini-MTZ datatype (CObsDataFile,CPhsDataFile, CMapCoeffsDataFile or CFreeRDataFile) and then an extra line appears in the interface with an option to <i>Merge to or split from monster MTZ</i>; this has a combo box to select from any defined <i>CMtzDataFile</i> file. The mini-MTZs that you define will appear in the user interface for the task and the system will automatically merge them to create  the monster-MTZ that is the program input file. To handle splitting an output monster-MTZ you also need to enter the names of the MTZ columns that are split out into the mini-MTZs. There is another possible complication if the program will only accept observed data or phases in a limited set of representations (see explanation <a href="./miniMTZs.html#representations">here</a>). If you set a data type <i>CObsDataFile</i> or <i>CPhsDataFile</i> with <i>input</i> function then a list of the possible representations will appear and you can un-check any which are unacceptable to the program.  The custom task run mechanism will attempt to convert data to an appropriate representation automatically.</p>
<p>Distributed with CCP4i2 there is an example custom task for running the model building program <a href="http://www.embl-hamburg.de/ARP">ARP-wARP</a>. The ARP-wARP program itself is not automatically included in the CCP4 distribution and you may need to download it from <a href="http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/download">CCP4</a> or the  <a href="http://www.embl-hamburg.de/ARP">ARP-wARP</a> site.  To import the example custom task choose <i>Custom task</i> from the <i>Customisation</i> menu and choose <i>Import</i> in the <i>Custom task Manager</i> dialog box and select the file <i>Your CCp4i2 directory/test/custom_tasks/arp_trace.ccp4_customtask.tar.gz</i>. You can then double-click the newly-imported <i>arp_trace</i> task to edit and see the contents. At the top of the <i>Create custom task</i> window you can see the name and the title (text that will appear in the interface).</p>
<p>The ARP-wARP autotrace script is run with a simple command line that includes the name of a monster-MTZ file that must include observed data and phases. In the <i>Create custom task</i> window the <i>Command line</i> field is the path to the ARP-wARP autotrace script (which you will probably need to edit appropriately for your computer) and keyword, 'datafile' and then the parameter '#HKLIN'. There is no command file for running ARP-wARP so that field is empty. The list of parameters is important for ensuring the correct behaviour of the interface. HKLIN is the one actual input file to ARP-wARP and is a monster-MTZ file of type <i>CMtzDataFile</i> but it is made up from OBSIN (observed data with data type CObsDataFile) and PHSIN (phases with data type CPhsDataFile) which have the <i>Merge to MTZ</i> value set to 'HKLIN' which is the cue to the system to create the monster-MTZ HKLIN from those files. For the input observed data ARP-wARP will only accept a limited set of representations and so the <i>Representation</i> field is set to 'Fmean'.<p>
<p>The output files from ARP-wARP are PDBOUT which has type CPdbDataFile and HKLOUT, a monster-MTZ of type CMtzDataFile. For both of these the <i>File path</i> field is filled in with a path to the expected output file. ARP-wARP creates a directory for output files with a default name devised from the current data and time so we can not predict it but we can use a '*' wildcard in the file path and, though it may look odd in this case, the output filenames include the name of the input MTZ file which will be 'HKLIN'. There are two further mini-MTZ output files defined, MAPOUT and DIFFMAPOUT that will contain map coefficients so have type 'CMapCoeffsDataFile' - these are split out from the program output HKLOUT file so have 'HKLOUT' in the <i>Merge to MTZ</i> field and have entries in the <i>List of column labels</i> field. Finally note the <i>Record in database</i> column: the two input and output monster-MTZ files are not recorded as they are regarded as temporary intermediate files but the input and output mini-MTZs and the output PDBOUT file are recorded.</p>
<p>Once the example ARP-wARP custom task is loaded the task title will appear in the <i>Task menu</i> in the <i>Custom tasks</i> section which is near the top of the list of tasks. If you click on this then the interface appears - the input requires just two files for the observed data and phases. The ARP-wARP script takes some time to run but you can follow progress by viewing the log file (right-mouse click on the job in the left project view window to get a context menu with a <i>View</i> option.) You can also see what files are created by the job by choosing the <i>Project directory</i> view from the tab options on the left side of the Project Viewer window and opening the directory folder for the appropriate job.</i>

<a name="pathname_expansions"><h3>Appendix - pathname expansions</h3>
<p>Some examples of pathname expansions:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>./*.pdb</b> finds files in the current directory with any filename and the file extension '.pdb' </li>
  <li><b>./*/*.pdb</b>finds files in any sub-directory  with any filename and the file extension '.pdb'</li>
  <li> <b>./[0-9]???.pdb</b> finds files in the current directory with a filename beginning with a character in the range 0 to 9 (i.e any number), followed by three characters that may be anything and the extension '.pdb'</li>
</ul>
