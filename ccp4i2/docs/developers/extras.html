<a name="what next"><h3>Supporting 'What next?'</h3>
<p>After each job the GUI presents the user with a list of reasonable tasks to perform next and a web page with more discussion of the options. It is the responsibility of the task author to provide the information for these facilities. Note that if the user opts to follow from a sub-job in a pipeline then it is the parent pipeline that is queried to provide the 'what next' information.</p>
<p>There are two mechanisms to provide the information; the simplest is as 
a WHATNEXT attribute of either the wrapper class (CPluginScript) or gui class (CTaskWidget). So, for example, for buccaneer the WHATNEXT is set as a list of names of tasks..</p>
<pre>
class CTaskBuccaneer(CCP4TaskWidget.CTaskWidget):
  TASKNAME = 'buccaneer'
  ...
  WHATNEXT = ['refmac_simple']
</pre>
<p>The more flexible approach is to have a function whatNext() in either the wrapper module or the gui module (note it is a function and not a member of the class). This is passed four arguments:
<table>
  <tr><td>jobId</td><td>The jobId of the job (or the jobId of the parent pipeline job if a sub-job is selected)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>taskName</td><td>The taskname of the job (or of the sub-job if a sub-job was selected)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>childJobNumber</td><td>The job number of the sub-job if a sub-job was selected</td></tr>
  <tr><td>projectName</td><td>The project name</td></tr>
</table>
<p>This function should return either a list of tasks that can be run
next or a list of task name and text to appear on the GUI. For example
for buccaneer_build_refine:</p>

<p>The WHATNEXT parameter or the return from <i>whatNext()</i> is
normally expected to be a list of tasknames but the list item
could be a list containing two items: the taskname and the
filepath of a params file that provides default parameters to the next
task. The params file path should be of the form </p>
<pre>
$CCP4I2/pipelines/bucref_mr/scripts/bucref_after_experimental.params.xml
</pre>
<p>i.e. the file is expected to be found somewhere in the CCP4I2 directory.  The
<i>bucref_after_experimental.params.xml</i> is used to set one input
parameter in the <i>Autobuild protein</i> gui so that it expects input from
experimental phasing.</p>
<p>In principle this mechanism could be used to
pick up a project or task-specific file if the <i>whatNext()</i> function
returns a list including a reference to a file in the current project directory
of the form</p>
<pre>
$PROJECT/CCP4_JOBS/job_5/for_whatever_next_task.params.xml</pre>
<p>This is interpreted in the context of the project viewer that
understands $PROJECT to mean the current project directory.  (Note
this is not tested.) It is the responsibility of either the
wrapper or the <whatsNext()</i> function to provide
the params file in the project directory. </p>

<p>Each task should provide a web page with discussion of what to do
next. This should be $CCP4I2/docs/whatnext/<i>taskName</i>.html.</p>

<a name="bibliographic_references"/><h3>Bibliographic References</h3>
<p>Task reports will normally include a section of bibliographic references for software used by the task. This is presented as text with options to link to the original paper (if available on-line) and to download the reference in either MedLine (suitable for EndNote) or BibTeX format.  The task implementer must provide two files containing the references in the appropriate formats.  These files should be called <i>wrappers/mytask/script/mytask.medline.txt</i> and  <i>wrappers/mytask/script/mytask.bibtex.txt</i>.  The first can be created and downloaded from the PubMed site:
<br/><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/advanced">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/advanced</a>
<br/>After selecting the references use the <i>Send to</i> tool at the top left of the page to create a file in MEDLINE format.  To get the BibTeX file input the PUbMed Ids (PMIDs) (or other suitable search query) here:
<br/><a href="http://www.bioinformatics.org/texmed/">http://www.bioinformatics.org/texmed/</a></p>
<p>The MedLine file is used by CCP4i2 to generate the information in the report and if a copy of the paper is available online the MedLine entry should be edited to append the a line such as:<p>
<pre>
URL - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3069738/
</pre>
<p>If there are multiple references then the first in the file will be treated as the one for which citation is preferred.</p>
<p>Note that the 'MEDLINE' format file can be imported into <i>EndNote</i> as <i>PubMed(NLM)</i> format (found in the <i>Other filters</i> menu of the <i>Import</i> tool.</p>
<p>These references are accessed from three places in the gui:
<br/>References for the current task can be accessed from the <i>Help</i> menu in the project viewer. These references are autogenerated from the contents of the <i>medline</i> file for the task and recursively for sub-tasks that are specified by the script's SUBTASKS parameter.
<br/>References are also automatically generated and appended to a job report. But if the tasks used by a pipeline are only determined at run-time then it may be worthwhile specifying references in the report explicitly see <a href="./reports.html#references">here</a>.
<br/>PLACEHOLDER - not yet implemented: autogenerated for all tasks used in determining a data file seelcted by the user.
</p>


<a name="task documentation"><h3>Task documentation</h3>
<p>Each task should have a page of documentation named
$CCP4I2/docs/tasks/<i>taskName</i>/index.html and any images or other
material for the page should be in the same directory.  There is a
template html file: <i>ccp4i2/docs/tasks/resources/template.html</i>.
See the <i>parrot</i> documentation for example of required style.</p>
<p>In order to support installation of third party created pipelines
with all resources in one directory the task documentation can as
be in $CCP4I2/pipelines/<i>taskName</i>/docs/index.html.</p>

<a name="screen grabs"><h3>Creating documentation images</h3>
<p>There is a customised screen grab tool in the <i>Developer
tools</i> sub-menu of the <i>Utilities</i> menu.  The tool will grab
either the task input frame or report as it appears in the Project
viewer. You can resize the window and use the scroll bar to set up the
required frame size.  Beware with the task input you should resize the
window to eliminate any space below the input widgets and for reports
try to keep all screenshots the same width for a neater presentation
in the web page.</p>
<p>For the first screenshot of a new task you will be prompted to
select a directory to contain the screenshots and these will be
automatically named:
<br/> <i>directory/taskname_</i>task<i>_1.png</i>  or
<br/> <i>directory/taskname_</i>report<i>_1.png</i>  etc.
</p>
<p>To standardise documentation screenshot appearance please use the images of
numbers in <i>ccp4i2/docs/resources</i>.  One way to add these to the
screenshot is using <i>Inkscape</i>: open the screenshot image then use
<i>File->Import</i> to import each label <i>svg</i> file and then drag the label to
correct place. Save by using the <i>File->Export PNG image</i>.</p>
