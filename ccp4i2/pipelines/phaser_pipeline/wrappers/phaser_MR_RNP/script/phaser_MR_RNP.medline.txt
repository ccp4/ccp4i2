AB  - Phaser is a program for phasing macromolecular crystal structures by both
      molecular replacement and experimental phasing methods. The novel phasing
      algorithms implemented in Phaser have been developed using maximum likelihood and
      multivariate statistics. For molecular replacement, the new algorithms have
      proved to be significantly better than traditional methods in discriminating
      correct solutions from noise, and for single-wavelength anomalous dispersion
      experimental phasing, the new algorithms, which account for correlations between 
      F(+) and F(-), give better phases (lower mean phase error with respect to the
      phases given by the refined structure) than those that use mean F and anomalous
      differences DeltaF. One of the design concepts of Phaser was that it be capable
      of a high degree of automation. To this end, Phaser (written in C++) can be
      called directly from Python, although it can also be called using traditional
      CCP4 keyword-style input. Phaser is a platform for future development of improved
      phasing methods and their release, including source code, to the crystallographic
      community.
