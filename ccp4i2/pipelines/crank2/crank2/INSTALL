                      INSTALLATION OF CRANK2
                      ----------------------


Installation for use from command line
--------------------------------------

Add the crank2/bin directory (containing the crank2, and possibly also the programs, executables) 
to the PATH environment variable.
(This is the same directory that contains this INSTALL file. Please do not add any other crank2 
subdirectories to the PATH!)

For example, in bash:

export PATH=/path-to-crank2-bin-directory:$PATH



Installation for use from CCP4 graphical interface
--------------------------------------------------

1) Set the CRANK2 directory

If you are using bash, add the following to your .profile or .bashrc or .bash_profile file:

export CRANK2=/path-to-crank2-directory

If you are using tcsh or csh, add the following to your .tcshrc or .login file:

setenv CRANK2 /path-to-crank2-directory

where the /path-to-crank2 is the directory containing this INSTALL file.


2) Installation of the CCP4i interface

Click on "System Administration" -> "Install/uninstall Tasks".  

If you have an installation of an earlier Crank2 ccp4i gui, choose "Uninstall
an existing task" and "Crank2" before proceeding with the installation.

If you have administrator priviledges, you can install to the "main CCP4i" area, 
otherwise please switch to the "user's local CCP4i" area.
For "Task archive" choose the file /path-to-crank2-directory/ccp4i/crank2.tar.gz and
click on "Apply".  Restart ccp4i to make sure the CRANK2 variable is set (logging off
and on again might be needed in some cases as well).



Compilation of the CRANK2 (sub)programs
---------------------------------------

The prerequisity is CCP4 installed from sources (the ccp4 libraries and header files are needed). 
Then the following cmake command, issued in the crank2 directory, compiles and builds the binaries:
cmake src && make && make install

Note: in order for the new binaries to be used, the crank2/bin directory needs to be in the PATH
before the $CCP4/bin directory. Otherwise the CCP4 version of the programs is used (if existing).
