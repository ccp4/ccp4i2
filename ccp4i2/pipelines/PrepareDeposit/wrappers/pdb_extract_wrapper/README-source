             Installation and Usage Notes for the Pdb Extract Application
                            (Source Distribution)


1.  Installation

a.  Uncompress and unbundle the distribution using the following command:

        zcat pdb-extract-vX.XXX-XXX.tar.gz | tar -xf - 

b.  Set up the environment variables.
 
    - Define PDB_EXTRACT environment variable to point to the installation
    directory. Assuming that the installation directory is
    /home/username/pdb-extract-vX.XXX-XXX, execute in the shell:

        For C shell users:
          setenv PDB_EXTRACT /home/username/pdb-extract-vX.XXX-XXX
 
        For Bourne shell users:
          PDB_EXTRACT=/home/username/pdb-extract-vX.XXX-XXX; export PDB_EXTRACT

    - Add "bin" subdirectory to the PATH environment variable.
    Execute in the shell:

        For C shell users:
          setenv PATH "$PDB_EXTRACT/bin:"$PATH

        For Bourne shell users:
          PATH="$PDB_EXTRACT/bin:"$PATH; export PATH


2.  Building the Application

a.  Position in the pdb-extract-vX.XXX-XXX directory and run "make" command:

        cd pdb-extract-vX.XXX-XXX 
        make

    The application executables will be placed in the "bin" subdirectory.


    NOTE: The users who are working on Sun platform are strongly advised to
    check the compiler flags in etc/make.platform.sunos5 file. Depending on
    the compiler version, users may be required to make modifications to those
    compiler flags.


3.  Demonstration

There is an examples included in this distribution. It is located
in the subdirectories of "pdb-extract-vX.X/examples" directory. The directory
contains the following:

    input_data - contains the input data for the example
    deposit - contains the resulting files:
        Example_x.cif - this is the merged file created by "pdb_extract"
        Example_x.sf.cif - this is the structure factor for deposit and is
          created by "pdb_extract_sf"

To execute the examples, position in the appropriate directory and invoke
test.sh and test_script.sh scripts. For example:

    cd pdb-extract-vX.XXX-XXX/pdb-extract-vX.X/examples/Example_1
    ./test.sh
    ./test_script.sh
