			  NOTES AND REMINDER
The data template file contains data entries for unique chemical sequences 
present in the structure and other non-electronically captured information. 

PLEASE CHECK CATEGORIES 1 & 2: Before proceeding any further, make necessary 
corrections here so that all information in these categories are complete 
and correct.

You may choose to fill in CATEGORIES (3-19) either here or later in ADIT.

			GUIDELINES FOR USING THIS FILE
  1. Only strings included between the 'lesser than' and 'greater than' 
     signs (<.....>) will be parsed for evaluation by the program.
     NEVER change the data item names inside of the brackets.

  2. All alphanumeric values or strings that you entered in the different 
     categories should be within double-quotations. Blank spaces or carriage 
     returns within a pair of double quotes are ignored by the program. 
     
  3. All the input text CAN NOT contain double quotes or left or right of
     the 'less than' and 'greater than' signs.
     
  4. If more groups are needed, Same number of data items should be added.

================CATEGORY 2:   Sequence Information =======================
Enter one letter sequence for each polymeric entity in asymmetric unit

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
			  SOME DEFINITIONS
     An ENTITY is defined as any unique molecule present in the asymmetric 
     unit. Each unique biological polymer (protein or nucleic acids) in the 
     structure is considered an entity. Thus, if there are five copies of 
     a single protein in the asymmetric unit, the molecular entity is still 
     only one. Water and non-polymers like ions, ligands and sugars are 
     also entities. 

     Here we only consider the sequences of polymeric entities (protein or 
     nucleic acid).  

	        GUIDELINES FOR COMPLETING THIS CATEGORY
      * In a PDB or mmCIF format file, all residues of a single polymeric 
      entity should have one chain ID. Multiple copies of the same entity 
      should each be assigned a unique chain ID. The multiple chain IDs 
      should be separated by commas as 'A,B,C,...'. If incorrect chain IDs 
      are used the entity groups extracted by this program will not be 
      correct. To avoid this, make necessary corrections in the PDB or mmCIF 
      file used to generate the data_template file and regenerate the 
      data_template.text file. Alternatively, edit the extracted sequence 
      in this file to correctly represent the sequence and chain IDs of each 
      polymeric entity.  

      * In addition to chain IDs, this program uses distance geometry to 
      asses if there are any breaks in the polymer sequence. These breaks 
      may occur due to missing residues (not included in the model due to 
      missing electron density) or due to poor geometry. Four question marks 
      '????' are used to denote these chain breaks. Replace these question 
      marks with the sequence of residues missing from the coordinates. Also 
      add any residues missing from the N- and/or C-termini here.

      * If there are non-standard residues in the coordinates, this program 
      lists them according to the three letter code used in the coordinate
      file as (ABC). If all the residues in your sequence are nonstandard, 
      check and edit the sequence manually to represent it correctly in this 
      file. 

      * If any residue was modeled as Ala or Gly due to lack of the side-chain 
      density, the sequence extracted here will represent them as A or G 
      respectively. Correct this to the original sequence that was present in 
      the crystal.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Below is the one letter chemical sequence extracted from your PDB 
	coordinate file. The molecular entities are grouped and listed 
	together. 

PLEASE CHECK THE SEQUENCE of each entity carefully and modify it, as necessary.
Make sure that you REVIEW THE FOLLOWING:  
   * chain breaks due to missing residues, 
   * missing residues in the N- and/or C-termini, 
   * non-standard residues and 
   * cases of residues modeled as Ala or Gly due to missing side-chain density.
