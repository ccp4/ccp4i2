             Installation and Usage Notes for the Pdb Extract Application
                            (Binary Distribution)



1.  Installation

a.  Uncompress and unbundle the distribution using the following command:

        zcat pdb-extract-vX.XXX-XXX.tar.gz | tar -xf - 

b.  Set up the environment variables.

    - Define PDB_EXTRACT environment variable to point to the installation
    directory. Assuming that the installation directory is
    /home/username/pdb-extract-vX.XXX-XXX, execute in the shell:

        For C shell users:
          setenv PDB_EXTRACT /home/username/pdb-extract-vX.XXX-XXX

        For Bourne shell users:
          PDB_EXTRACT=/home/username/pdb-extract-vX.XXX-XXX; export PDB_EXTRACT

    - Add "bin" subdirectory to the PATH environment variable.
    Execute in the shell:

        For C shell users:
          setenv PATH "$PDB_EXTRACT/bin:"$PATH

        For Bourne shell users:
          PATH="$PDB_EXTRACT/bin:"$PATH; export PATH


2.  Demonstration

There is one example included in this distribution. It is located in the 
subdirectories of "pdb-extract-vX.X/examples" directory. The directory
contains the following:

    input_data - contains the input data for the example
    deposit - contains the resulting files:
        Example_x.cif - this is the merged file created by "pdb_extract"
        Example_x.sf.cif - this is the structure factor for deposit and is
          created by "pdb_extract_sf"

To execute the examples, position in the appropriate directory and invoke
test.sh and test_script.sh scripts. For example:

    cd pdb-extract-vX.XXX-XXX/pdb-extract-vX.X/examples/Example_1
    ./test.sh
    ./test_script.sh
