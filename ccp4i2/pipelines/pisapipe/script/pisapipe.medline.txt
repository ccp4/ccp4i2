AB  - We discuss basic physical-chemical principles underlying the formation of stable 
      macromolecular complexes, which in many cases are likely to be the biological
      units performing a certain physiological function. We also consider available
      theoretical approaches to the calculation of macromolecular affinity and entropy 
      of complexation. The latter is shown to play an important role and make a major
      effect on complex size and symmetry. We develop a new method, based on chemical
      thermodynamics, for automatic detection of macromolecular assemblies in the
      Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries that are the results of X-ray diffraction
      experiments. As found, biological units may be recovered at 80-90% success rate, 
      which makes X-ray crystallography an important source of experimental data on
      macromolecular complexes and protein-protein interactions. The method is
      implemented as a public WWW service.
