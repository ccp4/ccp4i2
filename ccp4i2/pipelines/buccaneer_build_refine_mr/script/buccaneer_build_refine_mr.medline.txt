AB  - Two developments in the process of automated protein model building in the
      Buccaneer software are presented. A general-purpose library for protein fragments
      of arbitrary size is described, with a highly optimized search method allowing
      the use of a larger database than in previous work. The problem of assembling an 
      autobuilt model into complete chains is discussed. This involves the assembly of 
      disconnected chain fragments into complete molecules and the use of the database 
      of protein fragments in improving the model completeness. Assembly of fragments
      into molecules is a standard step in existing model-building software, but the
      methods have not received detailed discussion in the literature.

TI  - The Buccaneer software for automated model building. 1. Tracing protein chains.
PG  - 1002-11
AB  - A new technique for the automated tracing of protein chains in experimental
      electron-density maps is described. The technique relies on the repeated
      application of an oriented electron-density likelihood target function to
      identify likely C(alpha) positions. This function is applied both in the location
      of a few promising ;seed' positions in the map and to grow those initial C(alpha)
      positions into extended chain fragments. Techniques for assembling the chain
      fragments into an initial chain trace are discussed.
