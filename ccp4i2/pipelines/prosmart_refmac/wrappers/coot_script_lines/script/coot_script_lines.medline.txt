AB  - Coot is a molecular-graphics application for model building and validation of
      biological macromolecules. The program displays electron-density maps and atomic 
      models and allows model manipulations such as idealization, real-space
      refinement, manual rotation/translation, rigid-body fitting, ligand search,
      solvation, mutations, rotamers and Ramachandran idealization. Furthermore, tools 
      are provided for model validation as well as interfaces to external programs for 
      refinement, validation and graphics. The software is designed to be easy to learn
      for novice users, which is achieved by ensuring that tools for common tasks are
      'discoverable' through familiar user-interface elements (menus and toolbars) or
      by intuitive behaviour (mouse controls). Recent developments have focused on
      providing tools for expert users, with customisable key bindings, extensions and 
      an extensive scripting interface. The software is under rapid development, but
      has already achieved very widespread use within the crystallographic community.
      The current state of the software is presented, with a description of the
      facilities available and of some of the underlying methods employed.
