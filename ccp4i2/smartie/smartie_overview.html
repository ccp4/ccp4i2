<h1>smartie.py: CCP4 logfile parser tools</h1>

<p><b>Usage documentation for version 0.0.15</b></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><b>smartie</b> is a set of Python classes and methods intended 
to provide tools for parsing the content of CCP4 logfiles. The name
"smartie" reflects its origins as the driver for a "smart logfile
browser", although this aim has not yet been realised.</p>

<p>The <b>logfile</b> class lies at the heart of smartie. Once
populated from a file, a logfile object gives a high-level view of
that file in terms of "components" (CCP4i comments, individual
program logs, tables, warnings, summaries and so on). The logfile
class was loosely inspired by the Javascript DOM (document object model)
for describing hypertext documents, although it is far more limited
at present.</p>

<p>To see an example of smartie parsing a logfile, feed it one of
the example logfiles included in the distribution, e.g.:</p>

<pre>
<b>% python smartie.py 7_refmac5.log</b>
</pre>

<p>or all the example log files:</p>

<pre>
<b>% python smartie.py *.log | more</b>
</pre>

<p>or try it on a file of your own.</p>

<h2>Module documentation</h2>

<p>The documentation for the classes and functions in the smartie
module (generated using <tt>pydoc</tt>) are here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="smartie.html">smartie.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There are also <a href="#class_overviews">overviews of the different
classes below</a>.</p>

<h2>Usage examples</h2>

<h3>1. Interrogating logfiles</h3>

<p>To create a new logfile object describing (say) a CCP4i logfile
from a <tt>scala</tt> job, we use the smartie's <tt>parselog</tt>
method:</p>

<pre>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; import smartie</b>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile = smartie.parselog("22_scala.log")</b>
</pre>

<p>We can then find out for example how many "fragments" smartie
thought it had found in this file:</p>

<pre>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile.nfragments()</b>
<em>8</em>
</pre>

<p>Fragments are any particular chunk of logfile that smartie
recognised. We can interrogate the type of fragment, for example:</p>

<pre>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile.fragment(0).isccp4i_info()</b>
<em>True</em>
</pre>

<p>If we're only interested in the fragments that looked like individual
program output then we can also find out how many programs it thought
it had found, by querying its list of program logs:</p>

<pre>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile.nprograms()</b>
<em>7</em>
</pre>

<p>We can ask it some questions about individual fragments, for
example:</p>

<pre>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile.program(1).isccp4()</b>
<em>True</em>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile.program(1).name</b>
<em>'Scala'</em>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile.program(1).version</b>
<em>'5.99'</em>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile.program(1).termination_message</b>
<em>'** Normal termination **'</em>
</pre>

<p>It is also possible to get a list of the keyword input lines
for each program logfile, for example:</p>

<pre>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile.program(0).name</b>
<em>'SORTMTZ'</em>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile.program(0).keywords()</b>
<em>['ASCEND', 'H K L M/ISYM BATCH']</em>
</pre>

<p>For each program any "logical name/filename" pairs found in
the logfile are also stored and can be retrieved. To get a list
of the logical names associated with files that were opened:</p>

<pre>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile.program(1).logicalnames()</b>
<em>['HKLIN', 'HKLOUT', 'SYMINFO']</em>
</pre>

<p>Then, to find out what the associated file is for a particular
logical name:</p>

<pre>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile.program(1).logicalnamefile("HKLIN")</b>
<em>'/home/pjx/PROJECTS/myProject/aucn_sorted.mtz'</em>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile.program(1).logicalnamefile("HKLOUT")</b>
<em>'/tmp/pjx/PROJECT_22_2_mtz.tmp'</em>
</pre>

<p>The logfile class offers similar methods for fragments which
are not CCP4 program output but are (for example) messages from
CCP4i. Smartie also has a <tt>summarise</tt> function which will
print a report of the logfile contents:</p>

<pre>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile = smartie.parselog("22_scala.log")</b>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; smartie.summarise(logfile)</b>
<em>Summary for 22_scala.log

This is a CCP4i logfile

8 logfile fragments

Fragments:
        CCP4i info
        Program: SORTMTZ
        Program: Scala
        Program: MTZDUMP
        Program: UNIQUE
        Program: FREERFLAG
        Program: CAD
        Program: FREERFLAG

7 program logfiles

Programs:
        SORTMTZ v5.99   (CCP4 5.99)
        Scala   v5.99   (CCP4 5.99)

                Tables:
                Table: ">>> Scales v rotation range, red_aucn"
                Table: "Analysis against Batch, red_aucn"
                Table: "Analysis against resolution , red_aucn"

...</em>
</pre>

<p>The fragments and fragment-derived objects (programs and ccp4i_info)
also allow the text of the fragment to be retrieved from the logfile.
For example:</p>

<pre>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile = smartie.parselog("22_scala.log")</b>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; prog = logfile.program(0)</b>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; print prog.retrieve()</b>

</pre>

<h3>2. Extracting summaries from marked up logfiles</h3>

<p>As of version 0.0.8, logfile objects store information about blocks
of "summary" text that are found in the source logfile. A summary block
is a section of logfile output that is enclosed within
&lt;!--SUMMARY_BEGIN--&gt; and &lt;!--SUMMARY_END--&gt; tags, for
example:</p>

<pre>&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT COLOR="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;!--SUMMARY_BEGIN--&gt;

================================================================================

Summary data for Project: DMSO Crystal: DMSO Dataset: red_aucn

                                           Overall  OuterShell

  Low resolution limit                       35.27      3.16
  High resolution limit                       3.00      3.00
...
&lt;!--SUMMARY_END--&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;
</pre>

<p>There are a number of methods available to interrogate the summary block
information, for example: to find out how many summary blocks a logfile
contains:</p>

<pre>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile = smartie.parselog("22_scala.log")</b>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile.nsummaries()</b>
<em>30</em>
</pre>

<p>i.e. the logfile holds 30 summary blocks. For each summary block the
start and end lines in the source logfile can be retrieved, as can the
actual text, for example to get information on the 13th summary block in
a log file:</p>

<pre>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile.summary(12).start()</b>
<em>853</em>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile.summary(12).end()</b>
<em>855</em>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; print logfile.summary(12).retrieve()</b>
<em>&lt;B&gt;&lt;FONT COLOR="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;!--SUMMARY_BEGIN--&gt;
Logical name: CORRELPLOT, Filename: /home/pjx/PROJECTS/myProject/PROJECT_22_correlplot.xmgr
&lt;!--SUMMARY_END--&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/B&gt;</em>
</pre>

<p>It's not clear that this functionality is particularly useful. One
application is to write out all the summaries in one go e.g.:</p>

<pre>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(0,logfile.nsummaries()):</b>
<b>...    print logfile.summary(i).retrieve()</b>
<b>...</b>
</pre>

<p>(In this last example, Smartie's <tt>strip_logfile_html()</tt> command
could also be used to remove any HTML tags in the output - and to escape any
HTML special characters - in order to make the summary output easier to
read.)</p>

<p>This functionality is provided in the
<a href="show_summary.py">show_summary.py</a> example script.</p>

<h3>3. Working with tables and graphs</h3>

<p>Once a logfile object has been constructed from a file, smartie
offers various ways to find out about the tables associated with
the file overall, and with individual programs and fragments.</p>

<p>We can ask it about tables that it found for an individual
fragment or program:</p>

<pre>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile.fragment(2).ntables()</b>
<em>7</em>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile.program(1).tables()[3].title()</b>
<em>'Analysis against intensity, red_aucn'</em>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile.program(1).tables()[4].ngraphs()</b>
<em>4</em>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile.program(1).tables()[4].table_graph(0).title()</b>
<em>'Completeness v Resolution '</em>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile.program(1).tables()[4].nrows()</b>
<em>10</em>
</pre>

<p>We can also ask it similar questions about tables in the logfile
as a whole, for example:</p>

<pre>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile.ntables()</b>
<em>7</em>
</pre>

<p>We can also fetch a table in a logfile or a program by specifying
a regular expression pattern that matches the table title, for
example:</p>

<pre>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile = smartie.parselog("7_refmac5.log")</b>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile.tables("Rfactor analysis, stats vs cycle")[0].title()</b>
<em>'Rfactor analysis, stats vs cycle'</em>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; logfile.program(0).tables("Cycle   11")[0].title()</b>
<em>'Cycle   11. Rfactor analysis, F distribution v resln'</em>
</pre>

<p>For a particular table we can get the values for a particular
column:</p>

<pre>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; tbl = logfile.tables()[6]</b>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; tbl.col("Rfree")</b>
<em>['0.178', '0.196', '0.204', '0.210', '0.215', '0.221', '0.222', '0.225',
'0.227', '0.228', '0.229']</em>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; tbl.col("Rfree")[-1]</b>
<em>'0.229'</em>
</pre>

<h3>4. Using the table class to create tables and graphs</h3>

<p>smartie's table, table_graph and table_columns are intended to
be useful not only for reading tables from logfiles, but also for
constructing and writing them.</p>

<p>In outline the steps involved are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new table e.g.
    <tt>tbl = smartie.table(<em>title</em>)</tt>
</li>
<li>Define a set of columns e.g.
    <tt>tbl.addcolumn(<em>column_name</em>)</tt>
</li>
<li>Add data to the table "row-wise" e.g.
    <tt>tbl.add_data(<em>dictionary</em>)</tt>
</li>
<li>(Optionally) add graph definitions e.g.
    <tt>tbl.definegraph(<em>title</em>,<em>column_list</em>)</tt>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Graph definitions are required in order to generate $TABLE marked-up
loggraph table using the table.loggraph() and related methods.</p>

<p>An example of creating and populating a new table can be found in
the smartie.table_example() method. Alternatively:</p>

<pre>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; tbl = smartie.table("A table with random data")</b>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(0,3):
...     col = tbl.addcolumn("col_"+str(i))
...</b>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; for j in range(0,6):
...     tbl.add_data({"col_0":j,"col_1":j*2,"col_2":j*3})
...</b>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; tbl.definegraph("An arbitrary graph",("col_0","col_1"))</b>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; tbl.definegraph("Another arbitrary graph",("col_0","col_2"))</b>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; print tbl.loggraph()</b>
<em>$TABLE: A table with random data:
$GRAPHS
 :An arbitrary graph:A:1,2:
 :Another arbitrary graph:A:1,3:
$$
  col_0  col_1  col_2 $$ $$
      0      0      0
      1      2      3
      2      4      6
      3      6      9
      4      8     12
      5     10     15
$$</em>
</pre>

<p>If you want the graph to be written with the Jloggraph applet markup also
included then you can use instead:</p>

<pre>
<b>&gt;&gt;&gt; print tbl.jloggraph()</b>
<em>&lt;applet width="400" height="300" code="JLogGraph.class"
codebase=""&gt;&lt;param name="table" value="
$TABLE: A table with random data:
$GRAPHS
 :An arbitrary graph:A:1,2:
 :Another arbitrary graph:A:1,3:
$$
  col_0  col_1  col_2 $$ $$
      0      0      0
      1      2      3
      2      4      6
      3      6      9
      4      8     12
      5     10     15
$$"&gt;&lt;b&gt;For inline graphs use a Java browser&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/applet&gt;</em>
</pre>

<p>Alternatively, the <tt>show</tt> method will just return the table body
(column titles plus data) as a block of text without any additional markup,
and the <tt>html</tt> method will return a similar table formatted with the
appropriate HTML tags (and with any special characters converted to their
HTML equivalents for correct display).</p>

<h2>Overview of Smartie classes</h2>

<p>Smartie offers the following principle classes:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <b>logfile</b> class, which gives a high-level description
    of a logfile made up of smaller fragments (currently called
    "programs" within the context of smartie, although not all of
    them are actually program logfiles) </li>
<li>the <b>fragment</b> class, which describes a generic fragment of
    a logfile, and additional <b>program</b> and <b>ccp4i_info</b>
    classes that are derived from it, and which typically describe the
    log from a single CCP4 program and messages from CCP4i respectively.</li>
<li>the <b>table</b> class, which describes a CCP4 formatted table</li>
<li>the <b>summary</b> class, which describes the location of a block
    of summary text (enclosed within CCP4 summary tags) within a
    logfile </li>
</ul>

<p>There are a number of additional classes support to support these:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <b>table_graph</b> and <b>table_column</b> classes provide a way to
    interact with the components of <b>tables</b></li>
<li>the <b>keytext</b> class describes warnings from CCP4 programs
    that are typically found embedded in program logfiles.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally there are also some classes which are primarily intended for
use internally to smartie:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <b>buffer</b> and <b>tablebuffer</b> classes</li>
</ul>

<p>A logfile object is populated and returned by the
<b>parselog()</b> function. This takes a file name as a single
compulsory argument; the optional "progress" argument specifies
a number of lines at which to report progress when parsing the
file. It can recognise the following features in a logfile:</p>

<ul>
<li>CCP4 program banners (both standard and "phaser-style")</li>
<li>CCP4 program terminations (both standard and "phaser-style")</li>
<li>CCP4-formatted tables</li>
<li>CCP4-formatted warnings from CCPERR</li>
<li>CCP4i logfile "head" and "tail" (termination)</li>
<li>CCP4i information messages</li>
<li>CCP4 "summary" tags enclosing blocks of summary text</li>
</ul></p>

<p>parselog reads a logfile and returns a logfile object based
on the file contents. A logfile object holds lists of <em>fragments</em>,
<em>programs</em>, <em>tables</em>, <em>keytext messages</em>,
<em>CCP4i information messages</em> and <em>summary blocks</em>.</p>

<h2>Applications using Smartie</h2>

<p>Smartie is currently used in three applications:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/MrBUMP/">MrBUMP</a> automated
    molecular replacement program uses Smartie's table extraction and
    manipulation functionality to help in processing output from
    some of the underlying programs</li>
<li>The "baubles" program uses smartie to analyse a CCP4 logfile
    before reformatting it in a mixture of HTML, CSS and Javascript
    for display in a web browser.</li>
<li>The "starKey" program developed as part of CCP4's contribution to
    the BIOXHIT project uses Smartie to gather information about which
    programs were run by a particular CCP4i task - see
    <a href="http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/projects/bioxhit_public/">CCP4-BIOXHIT:
    Available Files</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Known issues/to-do list</h2>

<ul>
<li>When constructing tables there is no way to validate them (e.g.
    checking that there are the correct number of rows in each
    column etc) before writing out</li>
<li>The API for the table and related classes needs a review and
    overhaul in the context of actual usage</li>
<li>The fragment class should have better methods to query what type
    of fragment (program, table etc).</li>
<li>Deal properly with HTML and SUMMARY markup of CCP4 logfiles -
    for example, by taking this into account when looking for start
    and end</li>
<li>Improvements to the CCP4i header, tail and messages - most
    likely make these into dedicated subclasses of the fragment
    class.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Change log</h2>

<h3>Changes in 0.0.15</h3>

<ul>
<li><tt>buffer</tt> class now supports <tt>len(buffer)</tt> for retrieving
    number of lines stored.</li>
<li>Table parsing errors: <tt>parselog</tt> reports filename and location of
    tables that cannot be properly parsed, and warning from
    <tt>table.__populate_columns()</tt> has been updated to be less cryptic.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes in 0.0.14</h3>

<ul>
<li><tt>table.show()</tt> has new optional argument <tt>pad_columns</tt>,
    which controls whether data items in table columns are padded with
    spaces in order to align them. <tt>table.loggraph()</tt> also
    supports this argument.</li>
<li><tt>strip_logfile_html</tt> tries to salvage spacegroup names that have
    been written in the form &lt;P 41&gt;, using new function
    <tt>tag_is_spacegroup</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>buffer</tt> class has a new <tt>all()</tt> method: this returns
    the whole buffer as a string, so can be used instead of the <tt>tail</tt>
    method for buffer objects which do not have a fixed size.</li>
<li><tt>parselog</tt> now creates <tt>table</tt> objects for any table-like
    feature that is found, even if the table cannot subsequently be parsed.
    The raw text of a table is always available using the
    <tt>table.rawtext()</tt> method, even if the table is not parsed
    correctly, and diagnostic warnings to stdout have been reduced to a
    single line.</li>
<li><tt>parselog</tt>: the limit of 1000 lines has been removed from the
    tablebuffer, so arbitrarily large tables can now be processed (within
    system limits).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes in 0.0.13</h3>

<ul>
<li>Bug fix: fix </tt>len(fragment)</tt> function so that it always
    returns zero or greater.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes in 0.0.12</h3>

<ul>
<li>Bug fix: patternmatch.isccp4banner() has been updated to recognise
    CCP4 version numbers that include a trailing lower-case letter
    e.g. 6.0.99a. Previously programs with these version numbers
    did not have their banners identified by smartie.</li>
<li>The number of lines in the logfile that belong to a fragments (or
    program) object can be obtained by using the </tt>len</tt> function,
    e.g. len(fragment).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes in 0.0.11</h3>

<ul>
<li>logfile class: the "source" log file name is now stored as an
    absolute path.</li>
<li>Updates to the smartie directory structure: example logfiles are
    now in the "logfiles" subdirectory.</li>
<li>"test" subdirectory contains a basic set of unit tests for some
    of the pattern matching functions in smartie - it can be run
    using <tt>python test/test_smartie.py</tt>.
</ul>

<h3>Changes in 0.0.10</h3>

<ul>
<li>show_summary.py: example script that uses smartie to process a
    logfile and then prints the text enclosed in summary tags.</li>
<li>$TABLE recognition failed for some examples where the table
    title contains ":" characters before the end of the title string.
    In this case smartie would complain that it couldn't process the
    table - now it applies a second matching step with fewer
    constraints before giving up.<li>
<li>table.jloggraph(): now escapes special HTML characters in table
    and graph titles when generating applet code, including double
    quotes &quot; - otherwise these can cause problems with
    JLogGraph's parsing of the result table.</li>
<li>escape_xml_characters(): now also escapes double quotes and
    replaces them with &amp;quot;. Updated to use "replace" rather
    than regular expressions (Kevin Cowtan).</li>
<li>parselog: buffer size increased to 50 lines, which means that
    features of up to 50 lines can be recognised (used to be
    10) (Kevin Cowtan).</li>
<li>patternmatch class: methods for detecting program banners and
    termination messages now have an additional fast test which
    skips the full regular expression tests if not passed - this
    has resulted in a significant speed-up (Kevin Cowtan).</li>
<li>retrieve functions: this has been modified and should be faster
    now for big files. Previously it was slow due to sub-optimal
    usage of the linecache module.</li>
<li>table.show(): always printed tables as $GRAPHS, even if they were
    originally $SCATTER plots - now fixed.</li>
<li>Bug fix: table_column.append() always converted numerical values
    to integers, regardless of whether they were actually integers or
    floats. Now floats should be properly treated.</li>
<li>table_graph.graphcols(): new method that returns a list of the
    column names that make up the graph.</li>
<li>table class: new methods to make it easier to build tables
    from scratch, specifically:<br />
    table.list_columns(): return a list of the column names defined
    in the table<br />
    table.add_data(): add a "row" of data to the table<br />
    table.definegraph(): add a new graph definition to the table
    based on the existing columns.<br />
    The table_example() function has also been updated to show how
    this new methods can be used to make a new table.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes in 0.0.9</h3>

<ul>
<li>tokenise() function: now recognises either single or double
    quotes as token delimiters (and quotes of one type can contain
    quotes of the other type).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes in 0.0.8</h3>

<ul>
<li>Minor modification to parselog, to set the start line for
    "unknown" program fragments to be immediately after the end of
    the previous fragment (relevant if you are using the retrieve()
    methods of programs and fragments).</li>
<li>Bug fix: escape_xml_characters() raised an exception if the
    supplied data was not a string, which caused problems with the
    table.html() method (now fixed).</li>
<li>Bug fix: table.jloggraph() method did not include the $TABLE..
    and other tags when generating the HTML code, so graphs would
    not display correctly (now fixed).</li>
<li>Significant update to docstrings to provide more extensive
    documentation in <a href="smartie.html">smartie.html</a>.</li>
<li>strip_logfile_html() updated to extract CCP4 formatted tables
    from &lt;param...&gt; used for JLogGraph displays.</li>
<li>Removed report_example() function.</li>
<li>Added new "summary" class, which describes the location of a
    block of summary text within a logfile that is marked up with
    CCP4 summary tags. logfile objects can store summary objects
    and parselog() will add them in the order that they are located
    in the file.<br />
    summary objects are not yet assocated with fragments.</li>
<li>New function copyfragment() allows one fragment or fragment
    subclass to be populated from another.</li>
<li>logfile class: new method fragment_to_program() will convert
    an existing fragment object stored in the logfile object to a
    program object, at the same time updating the program lists
    appropriately.</li>
<li>program class: added new methods addlogicalname(),
    logicalnames() and logicalnamefile() that allow the storage and
    retrieval of the logical name/file name pairs found in the
    program logfile.<br />
    The parselog() function now recognises the file opening reports
    in the logfile and adds the data to the program object
    automatically.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes in 0.0.7</h3>

<ul>
<li>parselog() recognises keyworded input lines (i.e. logfile lines
    starting with a " Data line---" preamble) and stores the lines
    themselves in the appropriate program objects. The list of keyword
    lines can be retrieved using the program.keywords() method.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes in 0.0.6</h3>

<ul>
<li>Table values are now stored as floats or integers as appropriate.
    Items that cannot be converted to numerical values are stored as
    strings, as before.</li>
<li>table object now has an nrows() method that returns the number of
    rows of data in the table. The table_column object also has a new
    nrows() method that returns the number of rows in a single column.</li>
<li>logfile and fragment classes have new tables() method, which by
    default returns the list of tables for that object. It can also
    return a subset of tables that match a regular expression for
    their titles, and thus supercedes the existing findtable()
    methods in those classes. The tables() method also supercedes
    the existing table() method, which is now deprecated.</li>
<li>Bug fix: findtable() method in logfile and fragment classes didn't
    work correctly, this is now fixed - see updated documentation.
    However, findtable() is now deprecated in favour of the new tables()
    methods in those classes.</li>
<li>Bug fix: fixed fragment class so that pickle.dump() can be used
    to serialise a smartie logfile object (previously caused a crash)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes in 0.0.5</h3>

<ul>
<li>Bug fix: handle cases where the logfile being processed
    doesn't appear to contain any recognisable features such as
    program banners or tables (previously this caused a crash).</li>
<li>Bug fix: handle log files with DOS-formatted line endings.</li>
<li>Updated to deal with old-style (pre-5.0) CCP4 program banners
    and termination messages (both 4.1 and 4.0).</li>
<li>Updated to deal with Phaser 1.3.3 program banner, which
    appears to differ from the 1.3.2 version.</li>
<li>Table processing improved to deal with tables that don't
    conform to the loggraph $TABLE specification.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes in 0.0.4</h3>

<ul>
<li><tt>table</tt> class: the <tt>findtable()</tt> method has an
    optional second argument that specifies where in the list to
    start the search from - see module documentation for more
    detailed information.</li>
<li><tt>table</tt> class: there is a new <tt>html()</tt> method
    that generates a HTML table with the column titles and
    data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes in 0.0.3</h3>

<ul>
<li>Bug fix: parselog now recognises CCP4 program names that
    contain bracket characters (previously failed to recognise
    names like "MOLREP(ccp4)9.0.08"). Added new example file
    <tt>3_molrep.log</tt> which originally exposed this
    problem.</li>
<li>Bug fix: parselog code was broken for handling incomplete
    program log files where the start banner is missing but the
    termination message is present, this is now fixed. Added new
    example files <tt>scala_nobanner.log</tt> and
    <tt>molrep_nobanner.log</tt>, which demonstrate this
    situation.</li>
<li>Added <tt>findtable()</tt> methods to <tt>logfile</tt>,
    <tt>fragment</tt> and <tt>program</tt> classes. This allows
    a table to be retrieved by specifying a regular expression
    which matches the table title.</li>
<li>The function of the <tt>table.show()</tt> has changed; by
    default it now returns only the table body (column titles
    plus data) without any additional markup. The behaviour in
    the previous version can be obtained either by specifying
    the <tt>loggraph</tt> argument as <tt>True</tt>, or by
    using the new <tt>table.loggraph()</tt> method - both of
    which return the table data formatted as a loggraph table.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes in 0.0.2</h3>

<ul>
<li>The logfile class now has a list of fragment objects, and
    the program object list is used exclusively for referring
    to logfile fragments that are from programs. There are new
    methods <tt>logfile.nfragments()</tt> and
    <tt>logfile.fragment(i)</tt> to access the fragment list,
    and the <tt>summarise</tt> function also includes summaries
    of the fragments.<li>
<li>The method for accessing attributes of a program object has
    changed, so now instead of e.g. <tt>program.name()</tt> you
    must use either <tt>program.name</tt> (i.e. no parentheses), or
    <tt>program["name"]</tt>, or <tt>program.get_attribute("name")</tt>
    (the first two methods simply wrap the last one).<br />
    The change in implementation means that there are no longer
    explicit methods defined in the program class to tell you
    what the available attributes are; instead use the
    <tt>program.attributes()</tt> method to get a list, and see
    the documentation in <a href="smartie.html">smartie.html</a>
    for descriptions of each attribute.</li>
<li>There is now a way to access the data in a table column
    by referencing its name, using the new <tt>col()</tt> method
    of the <tt>table</tt> class - for example
    <tt>table.col("Rfree")</tt> returns a list of the values
    in the "Rfree" column of the table, and
    <tt>table.col("Rfree")[-1]</tt> references the last value.</li>
<li>Added support for retrieving the text for a fragment
    directly from the logfile - the <tt>fragment</tt>,
    <tt>program</tt> and <tt>ccp4i_info</tt> classes all
    support the <tt>retrieve</tt> method to allow the text to
    be fetched from the file and returned as a string.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the <tt>jloggraph</tt> method of the <tt>table</tt>
    class (only the last line was ever returned).</li>
