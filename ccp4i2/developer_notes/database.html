<h2>CCP4i2 Developer Notes - Database</h2>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Useful docs: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/sql/">w3 schools
sql</a>, <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/lang.html">sql as understood
by sqlite</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-letter_acronym">wikipedia for TLAs etc</a>.</p>
<p>i2 uses sqlite accessed by the Python sqlite3 interface.  Discussion on
other options later. All access should be via the database api,
<i>dbapi/CCP4DbApi.py</i> and the
schema is <i>dbapi/database_schema.sql</i>. The db is usually opened as part
of startup by <i>utils/startup.py:startDb()</i> function and can be
accesed via <i>CCP4Modules.PROJECTSMANAGER().db()</i>.  By default the user database file
is <i>$HOME/.CCP4I2/db/database.sqlite</i> but this can be changed either as
command line argument (-db) or by the environment variables:</br>
CCP4_LOCAL_HOME which resets where .CCP4I2 and other project
directories are by default</br>
CCP4_LOCAL_DOTDIR resets .CCP4I2 parent path</br>
These are mostly useful for classroom environments with disk space
and/or network speed issues.</p>
<p>Note that Python sqlite has a stated requirement that the sqlite is in the
main thread. The database is accessed by both the main gui process and
the 'background' runTask processes. I have tried to minimise all
access but especially from runTask processes.</p>
<p>The present implementation expects the db to have a single user
access - the users login name is found automatically and checked
against the value saved in Users table (set when database created) and
may fail if they do not match. The gui (in startup.py:startDb() function) deals with this by asking the
user to provide the 'old' username as found in the db. There are tables in db such as
ProjectsUsersPermissions which are intended for a more sophisticated
multi-user access but are not fully implemented.</p>
<p>For each of the main tables in the database each row has an id which is a randomly generated
unique identifier that serves as the primary key. In Python this is
handled as a string (or as defined by <i>CCP4DbApi.UUIDTYPE</i>
valriable which is currently set
to str) and is widely used and saved in Python code.
There are also some tables (FileTypes, JobStatus) which contain
list of integers used like 'enums' in the 'main' tables.  The content
of these tables is often duplicated in definitions at the top of
dbapi/CCP4DbApi.py so take care to update both. </p>
<p>To <b>inspect the db</b> in the <i>Job list</i> the context (right mouse)
menus for jobs and files have a <i>View->Database entry</i>
option. Also the program <i>sqlitebrowser</i> is very useful and can also be
used to edit a db.</p>
<h4>Overview of CDbApi methods</h4>
<p>All access to the db is channeled through the <i>excute()</i> and <i>commit()</i>
methods so changes needed when porting to
alternative sql are hopefully localised to these methods.
Most methods in CDbApi create an sql command and use
<i>execute()</i> (always!) to execute that command. This function
traps and reports errors and if <i>setDiagnostic()</i> has been set True it will
print to terminal all executed sql commands. If the sql command has
changed the database then this must be followed by a call to <i>commit()</i>. If the
change is not commited then the process does not release the db and,
typically for the case of the gui holding the db, prevents the runTask from
reporting a job finished so it appears to run forever. If the sql
command is a 'getter' returning data then the <i>fetchAll2Py()</i> or
<i>fetchAll2PyList()</i> method should be called to return the data as lists
of appropriate Python data types. The difference between these
functions is that  <i>fetchAll2Py()</i> returns a single list of a
single column of data from the db but <i>fetchAll2PyList()</i> returns
a list of lists of multiple columns. Both of these functions
require as input either the Python type or list of Python types for the returned data.
</p>
<p>For the main tables in the database there are methods:<br/>
<b>createWhatever()</b> - create new row in table<br/>
<b>updateWhatever(whateverId=None,key=None,value=None)</b> - update key
column in row to value.<br/>
<b>getWhateverInfo(whateverId,mode=None)</b> - return a dictionary of data
for the whatever with id whateverId for all the columns listed in
mode argument. If mode is None (the default), then all the columns are
returned. If mode is a single column name then the single Python
value is return rather than a dict. The keys in the return dict are
the column names but all lower case.<br/>
<b>deleteWhatever(whateverId)</b> - delete the row with id whateverId</br>
</p>
<p>Note that, for convenience, the much used <i>getJobInfo()</i> can
return data taken from tables other than the
Jobs table: projectname, runtime (finish-start time),
parentjobnumber, childjobs, descendentjobs, performanceclass,
performance.</p>
<p>There are numerous methods to return more complex data combinations
required in specific gui context, to <a href="#gleanJobFiles" >load data from finished jobs</a>, to handle running jobs(?LINK),
and to support import/export of projects(?LINK).</p>

<p>The following review of db tables mentions several redundant and
'not yet fully implemented' tables and columns. There is a difficulty
that the sqlite <i>update</i> command will not remove columns - this can only be
done by copying the db without the no-longer-required features.</p>

<a name="database_projects"><h4>Projects and related tables</h4>
<p>The Projects table holds:
<ul><li>ProjectName - name as seen by user</li>
<li>ProjectDirectory - the full path to the prpject directory</li>
<li>UserId</li> - references to users table which holds the owners
login name</li>
<li>ProjectCreated - when project created</li>
<li>LastAccess - when user last appended project</li>
<li>ParentProjectId - reference to another project which is parent to
this on. <a href="../docs/general/tutorial.html#projects" >User
docs.</a></li>
<li>LastJobNumber - the number of the last job created in the
project</li>
<li>FollowFromJobID - the last  finished job whose output files become
input to next created job</li>
<li>LastCleanupTime - last time prject cleanup - redundant.</li>
<li>I1ProjectName - Name of equivalent i1 project. <a href="../docs/general/CCP4i1Projects.html" >User docs.</a> </li>
<li>I1ProjectDirectory - Directory of equivalent i1 project.</li>
</ul>
<p>ProjectsUsersPermissions is a table to hold project access details
for users other than the owner - not currently used.</p>
<p>ProjectExports and ProjectImports tables track whenever a project
is exported or imported. Currently this info is used in the gui to offer user
option to export only jobs created since last import/export. 
ProjectImports.ProjectExportDatabaseId references the databaseId of
the source of the imported data. There is potentially useful info on
'where did that job come from' in these tables but not currently
accessible from the gui.</p>
<p>Recently (Oct 2016) tables to support tags and comments on projects
have been added. (<a
href="../docs/general/searchTools.html#search_projects">Searching
projects docs</a>. The Tags table is a simple list of
tags but with Tags.ParentTagID enables grouping of tags into
heirarchy. The ProjectTags table associates a project with a tag. The
ProjectComments table saves comments with userid and time and
potentially could be used for 'conversation' on the project.</p>


<a name="database_jobs"><h4>Jobs and related tables</h4>
<ul><li>ProjectID - reference to project containing job</li>
    <li>ParentJobID - reference to parent job if it is sub-job in a pipeline</li>
    <li>JobNumber - a text string that identifies job to user
  (actually just an integer)</li>
    <li>JobTitle - short description as appears in gui and is editable
  by user</li>
    <li>UserId - user that created job</li>
    <li>UserAgent - application that created job - currently always i2
    gui</li>
    <li>CreationTime - time that job created, replaced with time it
    starts running</li>
    <li>FinishTime - time job finishs</li>
    <li>Status - reference to JobStatus table and
    CCP4DbApi.JOB_STATUS_TEXT list one-word status</li>
    <li>TaskName - name of task</li>
    <li>TaskVersion - version number of the task</li>
    <li>Evaluation - reference to JobEvaluation - appears as
    smiley/sad/etc icons in the gui Job list</li>
    <li>PreceedingJobID - reference to job from which input data was
    taken - this is tricky to define and not now very useful</li>	
    <li> processId</li>The system process id held while the job is
    running - used to kill job</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Comments table is a list of comments on specific jobs.</p>
  <p>JobKeyValues and JobKeyCharValues hold items of real or char data
  performance indicators
  that summaries the quality of the job result. See <a
  href="../docs/developers/pipelines.html#performance_indicators">dev
  docs</a>. The KeyTypes table lists the allowed
  JobKeyValues.KeyTypeID values.</p>

<a name="database_files"><h4>Files and related tables</h4>
<p>A record of a file is created in the Files table when the file is
either imported into i2 or the file is output by a job. The Files
record includes the jobId of the job importing/creating the file. If the file
was imported then it is also recorded in the ImportedFiles table
(whose columns include the name of the original source file).</p>
<p><b>FileUses</b> The file may be subsequently input into another job and the
FileUses table is used to associate the file with that other job (with
Role value indicating 'in').
A further complication is that a file may be ouput twice (sort-of) by a
sub-job in a pipeline and then being one of the final files output by the
whole pipeline - the file needs to be associated with two jobs and
so a FileUses entry (with a Role column value indicating 'out') is
used for the second job.</p>
<p><b>Filename</b> The Files.Filename column contains just the name of
the file (no path). A file is always expected to be in the job directory of the job
that created or imported it or in the CCP4_IMPORTED_FILES directory
for the project. The Files.PathFlag column indicates which of these it
is. There is a redundant Files.FilePath column (which can not be
easily removed form an sqlite db).</p>
<p><b>JobParamName</b> In both Files and FileUses tables there is the jobId of a job and
also a JobParamName column which contains the name of the parameter
from the task (e.g. XYZIN).</p>
<p><b>Annotation</b> Files.Annotation is a short text string to appear in the
gui.</p>
<p><b>File types</b> There are three Files columns containing flags to
denote some aspect of file type:</br>
<b>Files.FiletypeID</b> is the fundamental type which corresponds to a single
data class derived from CDataFile and possible values listed in
CCP4DbApi.FILETYPELIST.</br>
<b>Files.FileContent</b> Some types of file (notable the 'mini' MTZs) can hold data in different forms and this column flags that form -
permissible values depend on the Files.FiletypeID.</br>
<b>Files.FileSubType</b> For some types of file (eg CPdbDataFile) the
content of the file may only be appropriate for use in a some context
that use that type of file. This is an attempt at codifying that
problem - it is little used in practice.</br>
Note -- The names FileContent and FileSubType would probably be more
appropriate if reversed!
</p>

<p><b>ImportFiles</b> This table exists mostly to hold the <i>SourceFilename</i>
of an imported file. It also contains a checksum value for the source
file at the time of import. Any subsequent access to the source file
should check it has the same checksum i.e. is still the same file.</p>

<p><b>ExportFiles</b> Ideally when a user exports a file from i2 (presumably to
use in some other software) the export is noted in this table. When
another file is subsequently imported (presumably the output from the
other software) it should be associated with the exported file.  There
is a column <i>ImportFiles.ExportFileID</i> to make this connection.  This
is not fully implemented and used partly due to user resistance to
being organised.</p>

<p><b>FileAssociations</b> with support tables FileAssociationTypes,
FileAssociationRoles and FileAssociationMembers is intended to make an
association between two files such as the reflection data and
freer data. This is fully implemented in CDbApi but not used yet. The
CDbApi.createFileAssociation() method creates an entry in the
FileAssociations table and then for every file in the association adds
an entry to FileAssociationMembers with a reference to the
FileAssociations entry.</p>

<a name="gleanJobFiles"/><p><b>Loading file data</b>. The <i>params.def.xml</i> file associated with the job contains all
parameters associated with the job including the input and output data files. The <i>CDbApi.gleanJobFiles()</i>
method extracts data from the <i>params.def.xml</i> and creates the
Files and FileUse records. The
gleanJobFiles() method is passed a
CContainer instance containing the contents of the param file. The
method scans the inputData and outputData sub-containers for objects
of type derived from CDataFile and checks if the spcified file name
exists before creating a Files or FileUses record.</p>


<a name="database_databases"><h4>Databases and other assorted tables</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Databases table keeps a record of itself and all databases from
which data has been imported.</li>
<li>UserAgents is a table of 'enums' for applications which access the
db - currently just i2 gui.</li>
<li>UserRoles is enums for concept of different type of user - not
used.</li>
<li>Users - List of users - currently just the one user.</li>
<li>DirectoryAliases - copies i1 functionality of allowing user to
create alias to frequently user directory. No longer used.</li>
<li>XData - a table that could hold a text xml representation of any
data class - not used but potentially could be.</li>
<li>LastUniqueIds -redundant</li>
</ul>

<a name="updating_schema"><h4>Updating the schema</h4>
<p>Adding a new column or table requires a series of changes: updating
the schema, ensuring that existing databases get updated, esuring that
the various methods accessing the changed table are updated and
ensuring that the 'temp' tables used to import projects are in sync.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make a copy of your <i>.CCP4I2/db</i> directory</li>
  <li>Change the version and data at the top of the <i>database_schema.sql</i>
  comments</li>
  <li>Add a note of the changes to the list of changes in the
  schema comments</li>
  <li>Make the changes in database_schema.sql</li>
  <li>Add an update_<i>version</i>() method in <i>CCP4DbApi.py</i> - note
  that the version is what you are updating from (not to).</li>
  <li>Add a line to <i>updateDbSchema()</i> to call your new method</li>
  <li>Update the CDbApi.<i>WHATEVER</i>ITEMS and
  CDbApi.<i>WHATEVER</i>TYPES lists that (at top of file) - these are record
  of the data in each table and what Python data type they should be
  converted to.</li>
  <li>Concider any changes necessary to createWhatever(),
  updateWhatever(), getWhateverInfo(), and deleteWhatever()
  methods.</li>
  <li>If a new table has reference to Projects, Jobs or Files tables then it will
  need to be included in the deleteProject(), deleteJob() or
  deleteFile() methods.</li>
  <li>Many schema changes need to be replicated in
  dbapi/temp_database_sqema.sql which is used to temporarilly hold
  data when importing projects.  Some 'transient' data -
  e.g. ServerJobs, tracking remote running jobs, should not be
  exported so does not need to be in the 'temp' database. See
  <a href="import_schema_mismatch">import/export note</a>.</li>
  <li>Test that you existing db is updated safely and then try with
  the .CCP4I2 moved aside so db is created from scratch.</li>
  <li>Test export and import of a project.</li>
  <li>Before checking in inform ysbl-ccp4i2dev and advise them to save .CCP4I2/db - I would
  do this for all but the most trivial change.</li>
 </ul>
</body>
 </html>
 
<a name="COpenJob"/><h4>CDbUtils.COpenJob</h4>
<p>This class is used as a cache for info on one job to minimise db
access. It's contents are updated if the db is updated and it emits
appropriate change signals. The class is mostly used as a member of
CProjectViewer class.</p>
<p>COpenJob also contains methods to create and run jobs so it has
some of the functionality of CProjectViewer but accessible
programatically and non-graphically. COpenJob is currently used in the
project based testing (<i>CCP4ProjectBasedTesting.py</i>). It could be
useful in an automated system such as the <a href="../developer_projects/demo_i2_scripts/README"/>demo_i2_scripts</a>.</p>


<h4>Exporting and Importing Projects</h4>

 <p>i2 can export a whole project or some selected jobs from one
 project by creating a
 compressed (zip) file containing all or some restricted part of the project directory and an xml
 representation of the appropriate part of the database.  When the
 compressed file is imported i2 creates a new project or adds to an
 existing project as appropriate. The import mechanism is careful not
 to import jobs or files that already exist.  The import/export
 mechanism is heavily dependent on the UUIDs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">Wikipedia</a>) Projects.projectId,
 Jobs.JobId, Files.FileId to check what is already in the
 database.</p>
 <p>The interface to import/export is in
 <i>CCP4ProjectsManagerGui.py</i> and
 CCP4ProjectsManager.compressProject() is used to export selected jobs. An outline of
 the export process:
 <ul>
   <li>If a limited set of jobs is being exported use
<i> CDbApi.getJobInputFiles()</i> to list the files input to those jobs and
 also list the jobs that provide the input files. These additional files and
 jobs will be included in the export.</li>
   <li>Create an XML file,
 <i>project_directory</i>/CCP4_TMP/DATABASE_<i>time</i>.db.xml,
 containing a fragment of database created by
 <i>CDbApi.getTablesEtree()</i></li>
 <li>Create the compressed file in a separate thread using
 <i>CCP4Export.ExportProjectThread</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The import process is a tricky piece of code and should be changed
with extreme caution. Note the <i>CCP4Export.ImportProjectThread</i>
 is not actually a thread as could not access db from separate thread.
 The basic process:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Extract the project xml file from the compressed file
 (<i>ProjectsManager.extractDatabaseXml()</i>) and load the file header
  in <i>CCP4DbApi.CDbXml</i> class to get basic project info.</li>
  <li>Check the ProjectId of the imported project -
 dependent on whether it is already in db decide to create new or extend
  existing project - gui confirms this with the user.</li>
  <li><i>CDbXml.loadTempTables()</i> loads the xml into temporary
  tables.</li>
  <li>The <i>excl</i> column in the temporary tables flags any job or file
 that should not be imported because it already exists or the actual
 job directory or file failed to import to the project
 directory. <i>CDbXml.setExclInTempTables()</i> sets excl for any job/file
 that already exists in db and determines if the imported job numbers
  need changing.</li>
  <li><i>CDbXml.setExclImportedFiles()</i> why?</li>
  <li><i>CCP4Export.ImportProjectThread</i> unpacks compressed file to the
 project directory - this has access to the CDbXml object to check if
 file is to be copied - see <i>ImportProjectThread.extractJobsFromZip()</i>
  </li>
  <li><i>CDbXml.cleanupTempTables()</i> updates dependent temporary tables based on
  <i>TempJobs.excl</i></li>
  <li><i>CDbXml.importTempTables()</i> copies data from the temporary to main
  tables in database</li>
  <li><i>CDbXml.removeTempTables()</i> deletes the temporary tables.</li>
  </ul>
 

<a name="import_schema_mismatch"><p><b>Schema syncing issues.</b> There is a potential for problems if the import/export i2
 installation have different database schema. I believe the import code
 can handle getting tables or columns that it does not recognise or
 missing tables and columns but there may be issues with missing
 content.</p>
 
  <h4>Future database development issues</h4>
  <p>There has been discussion on enabling an alternative RDBMS to
  sqlite - the requiremenst for any alternative would be that they are free and
  ideally can be distributed by ccp4 or are easy for a user
  site to install. Comprehensive list RDBMS at <a
 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_relational_database_management_systems"/>wikipedia</a>. The
  advantage would be for a user site to have a central database for
  everyones projects.  One way to use this would be for
 the local sqlite db to remain the immediate db but to update to a
  central db regularly.<p>
  <p>Some notes:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Qt has a module to access some of the main RDBMSs- probably not
  built into ccp4 Qt.</li>
  <li>Obviously any centralised db must sort out security and which
  users access which projects.</li>
  <li>The 'handshaking' to the RRBMS is mostly handled by
  <i>CDbApi.connection()</i>, <i>CDbApi.execute()</i> and <i>CDbApi.commit()</i> and hopefully
  any changes can be localised to those methods.</li>
  <li>The sql language has different dialects - that used in i2
  is mostly very simple and generic and should port without problems -
  watch errors from<i> CDbApi.execute()</i> when testing.</li>
  <li>The method <i>CDbApi.getJobTree()</i> is a recursive search which may
  have portability issues - and probably could be written better in an
  alternative dialect.</li>
  <li>sqlite does not have a easy way to remove columns so there
 is some redundant stuff in the i2 db. The only way to remove it is to
 copy the whole database (without the unwanted bits) and this is
 probably worth doing as part of a move to any alternative sql
  base.</li>
  <li>There are sqlite extensions fts3 and fts4 which enable
  full-text-searching which might improove job/project searching. They
  are not in our current python environment</li>
 </ul>
