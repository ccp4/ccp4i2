<h2>CCP4i2 Developer Notes - Running jobs</h2>

<p>This is an outline of what happens from the user clicking the 'Run'
button to the report from the finished job being shown.</p>

<a name="starting"/><h4>Starting a job</h4>
<p>The 'Run' button/action is defined in <i>CProjectViewer</i> and, when
clicked calls <i>CTaskInputFrame.runTask()</i> which does:
<ul>
  <li><i>CTaskWidget.updateModelFromView()</i> - cascades down the task
  widgets to ensure the data objects are up-to-date with the widget
  content (they should be up-to-date but this is checking)</li>
  <li>Run <i>CTaskWidget.fix()</i> - base class version does nothing but may
  be reimplemented in tasks to do a final 'fix'</li>
  <li>Call <i>CTaskWidget.isValid()</i> and <i>CTaskWidget.taskValidity()</i> to
  return list of invalid/missing input. If there is invalid/missing
  then give user error report and quit running.</li>
  <li>Check if there is a block on running task locally (see
  LINK).</li>
  <li>Call <i>CProjectsManager.importFiles()</i> which will copy any selected
  file-to-import into the project CCP4_IMPORTED_FILES directory and
  record it in the database.
  Note that MTZs have been imported when they were selected
  due to requiring interactive user selection of columns.</li>
  <li><i>CTaskInputFrame.makeJobInputFile()</i> is called to write out the
  <i>input_params.xml</i> file for the job</li>
  <li>Call <i>CDbApi.gleanJobFiles()</i> to record input data in the
  database</li>
  <li>Action now depends on the mode of the task:
  <br/><i>editor</i> mode implies all necessary functionality was in the
  gui and job can just be reported finished to the database.
  <br/><i>runRemote</i> runMode is set if user clicked 'Run remote'
  button and so job goes in <a href="#remote">Running remotely</a>
  system.
  <br/><i>internal</i> the task script is run in the gui process by <i>CProjectManager.runInternalTask()</i> -
  usually for a trivially brief script
  <br/><i>default</i> the database is updated to set job status to queued.
  </li>
  <li>The task widget is redrawn with the widgets made non-editable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Running external jobs is controlled by <i>CJobController</i> class which
is instantiated on startup (<i>utils/startup.py
startJobController()</i>) with a timer calling<i> CJobController.doChecks()</i>
every 1sec. <i>doChecks()</i> calls <i>checkJobQueue()</i> which queries the
database for any queued jobs and if any are returned passes them to
<i>CJobController.runTask()</i> (or <i>CJobController.runOnServer()</i> for remote jobs).</p>
<p><i>CJobController.runTask()</i> uses the Qt <i>QProcess</i> class to run the task
in a separate process.
(There is also code to use Python <i>subprocess</i> but it does not emit a
signal (or anything equivalent) when
the job is finished and is less straightforward to manipulate the
environment of the external job). The <i>QProcess</i> class enables the
process environment to be edited (possibly to
pass some info as environment variables) and the process output is
redirected to <i>stdout.txt</i> and <i>stderr.txt</i>.  The 'finish' signal from
<i>QProcess</i> is connected to <i>CJobController.handleFinish()</i> and the job
started using <i>QProcess.start()</i>. The database is updated to set the job status to
'running'.</p>

<a name="running"/><h4>The non-graphical 'script' process</h4>
<p>The non-graphical process starts with the Python interpreter
running <i>bin/runTask.py</i> - this bootstraps a non-graphical i2
environment. (Note that it is very important to avoid any graphical
dependency as these scripts may be run on servers without any
graphical libraries - beware some weird crashes on servers may be due
to this failure.) The <i>runTask</i> script is passed the name of the job
<i>input_params.xml</i> on the command line. It will also take keyworded command
line argments to reset the database file or to specify a compressed
project file which is used in running on a server.</p>
<p>Each task in i2 should have a 'script' which is a subclass of
<i>CPluginScript</i> as explained in the <a
href="../docs/developers/pipelines.html">developers
docs</a>. 'Pipeline' scripts will use other scripts as
'subroutines'/'functions'. Between the <i>runTask</i> script and
the 'top' <i>CPluginScript</i> subclass there is the <i>CRunPlugin</i> class.
<p>The <i>runTask</i> script creates an instance of
<i>CCP4PluginScript.CRunPlugin</i> and passes it the <i>input_params.xml</i> or
compressed project file. Past versions of i2 have made <i>CRunPlugin</i> a
sub-class of Python <i>thread</i> so it ran as a separate
thread (hence some of the comments in the code). The separate thread
was intended to help trapping errors but that did not really work.
<i>CRunPlugin.run()</i> does most of the work of the class.
If <i>CRunPlugin</i> is passed a compressed project file (when it is
running on a server) then it unpacks the compressed file to temporary
directory and creates a temporary database. <i>CRunPlugin</i> decides the
job work directory by assuming the <i>input_params.xml</i> file is in the work
directory. The <i>jobId</i>, <i>projectId</i> and taskname are taken from the
<i>input_params.xml</i> header. <i>CRunPlugin.run()</i> creates an instance of
<i>CDatabaseHandler</i> which caches job metadata and has a few
methods to handle interaction with the database and this instance is
passed down to all instances of <i>CPluginScript</i>.</p>
<p><i>CRunPlugin.run()</i> uses <i>TASKMANAGER().getPluginScriptClass()</i> to get
the right <i>CPluginScript</i> subclass for the given taskname and
instantiates the class and uses <i>CPluginScript.setDbData()</i> to pass the
instance of <i>CDatabaseHandler</i> and other job
metadata. <i>CPluginScript.process()</i> is called to start the script
proper.</p>
<p>Pipeline tasks reimplement <i>CPluginScript.process()</i> to
control the flow of subtasks but a 'simple' task relies on the base class
<i>CPluginScript.process()</i> to actually run the wrapped program as
another process. <i>CPluginScript.process()</i> checks that input and
output parameters are ok before calling <i>processInputFiles()</i>
which should have been reimplemented by the task to make any
manipulations of the input data, then <i>makeCommandAndScript()</i>
which should be reimplemented to
create the comand line and script for the program and then it runs the
program. After the program finishes <i>process()</i> calls
<i>postProcess()</i> which checks the external process status and then
calls <i>processOutputFiles()</i> which
should be reimplemented by the task to do any manipulations of output
files.  <i>postProcess()</i> finally calls
<i>CPluginScript.reportStatus()</i> passing a SUCCEEDED or FAILED
flag. <i>reportStatus()</i> is responsible for finishing the task by
reporting the status to the database, saving the final parameters to
<i>params.xml</i> and emitting a finished signal. The final
<i>params.xml</i> is probably little changed from the
<i>input_params.xml</i> for the 'top' pipeline task but it is a useful
record of the parameters passed to subtasks programmatically.</p>
<p>The wrapped program is run as a separate process by the
<i>CProcessManager()</i> class. This has code to use either Python <i>subprocess</i>
or <i>QProcess</i> and currently uses <i>QProcess</i> for the ease of manipulation
of the process environment and the fact that there is a signal when
the external process finishes.  There should be one instance of
<i>CProcessManager()</i> per i2 process - accessed by
<i>CCP4Modules.PROCESSMANAGER()</i>. It should be used to start *all*
external processes. It maintains a record of all process and writes
useful diagnostic to <i>stdout</i> for all processes. 
</p>

<a name="finished"/><h4>Handling the finished job</h4>
<p>In the script process <i>CPluginScript.reportStatus()</i> reports the job status
(finished or failed) and the time to the database when the job completes. In the
graphical process the job controller
<i>CProjectsManager.checkForFinishedJobs()</i> is called at (1s) intervals
to call <i>CDbApi.getRecentlyFinishedJobs()</i> to query the database for
jobs the finished since the last check. When finished jobs are found
<i>CDbApi.getRecentlyFinishedJobs()</i> emits a <i>'jobFinished'</i>
signal. The job list code in <i>CCP4ProjectWidget</i> connects that signal to
updateJob() (via <i>updateFinishedJob()</i>) which updates the
<i>QProjectModel</i> for the job list to show the changed job status and
any output files.<p>
The database <i>'jobFinished'</i> signal is also recognised by
<i>CTaskWidget</i> (in <i>CCP4ProjectViewer.py</i>) and triggers
<i>CTaskWidget.handleJobFinished()</i> which resets which actions are
enabled in the project viewer and calls <i>CReportView.showOutput()</i> to
regenerate the job report.  Note that a 'running' report is triggered
by changes to the job <i>program.xml</i> file (the <i>FILEWATCHER()</i> =
<i>CFileSystemWatcher</i> which sub-classes <i>QFileSystemWatcher</i> is set to
watch that file).</p>

<a name="script_errors"/><h4>Handling script errors</h4>
<p>Handling errors either in the task script or in the external
program and providing meaningful feedback to users is a major
headache.
The task script should call <i>CPluginScript.appendErrorReport()</i> to
report any error or warning.  These errors are written to the job
<i>diagnostic.xml</i> file and presented to the user in the automatically
generated 'failed job' report (<i>CReportGenerator.makeFailedReport()</i>).
The 'core' <i>CPluginScript</i> code has thorough error trapping about any
calls to task-specific code but can only prevent crashes and return
very generic error messages.</p>
<p>The main cause of jobs stopping without trace is crashes in subjobs
that are run in asynchronous mode - this is a strong reason not to use
asynchronous mode.</p>


<a name="remote"/><h4>Running remotely</h4>
<p>See user <a href="../docs/general/servers.html">Server
documentation</a>. We hope that a 'system manager' or other competent
person will setup the remote servers for a user site and save the
configuration in
<i>ccp4/shared/ccp4i2/local_setup/serverSetup.params.xml</i>. 
<i>CCP4JobControllerGui.py</i> contains <i>CServerSetupWindow</i>
class which provides the gui to configure the server(s). It is
expected that there might be multiple servers using the same mechanism
- these can be setup as one 'server group' - the gui is provided by
<i>CServerGroupView</i> which is an i2 'view' widget for
<i>CCP4Annotation.CServerGroup</i>.</p>

<p>When the user clicks the 'Run on server' button
<i>CTaskInputFrame.runRemotely()</i> presents a dialog box
(<i>CCP4JobControlGui.CServerParamsDialog</i>) that loads the server config
file (so it knows what servers are available) and then offers the user the choice
the server and requests info such as password. If this dialog returns
'Accepted' status then the parameters entered by the user are
recovered by a call to <i>CServerParamsDialog.getParams()</i> and passed (along with a
<i>jobId</i>) to <i>CJobController.createServerParams()</i>.
<i>runRemotely()</i> then
calls <i>makeJobBall()</i> whose behaviour is dependent on whether or
not the server
 has access to the local file system. Firstly it always creates an xml version of a cutdown
database with only the info necessary to run this job. Then for
servers without access to the local file system it creates a tarball
containing all necessary input files for the job. When this is finished
the job status in the database is updated to 'queued'.</p>
<p>The <i>CJobController</i> class subclasses <i>CJobServer</i> which
provides the functionality to run jobs on a server. This separation
into another class/file was partly to make some useful code 
potentially available outside i2. <i>CJobServer._serverParams</i> is a Python dict 
with the keys being the <i>jobId</i> and dictionary item being an
instance of <i>CJobServer</i>, a small class to hold and access the
parameters for the server jobs. 
The call to <i>CJobServer.createServerParams()</i> creates an instance
of <i>CJobServer</i> and adds to <i>_serverParams</i> 
and also loads the data into the main
i2 database <i>ServerJobs</i> table. The database provides secure
storage even if the gui process is closed or crashes but the
<i>_serverParams</i> is used as cache to limit database access. The data in
<i>_serverParams</i> and in the database is deleted when the job completes or the user
deletes the job.</i></p>
<p>There are utility functions in <i>CJobServer</i> to support interaction with
remote machines. The interactions are
usually handled by the <i>paramiko</i> Python library and run in a
separate thread to avoid blocking the main thread. The <i>CJobServer</i> functions
that are run in separate thread have names starting with underscore
(e.g. <i>_transportFiles()</i> and it is important that if they fail
they emit a suitable signal that is handled by the main thread. Note
that the <i>sqlite</i> database should only be accessed from the main
thread!</p>
<p>The <i>CJobServer</i> utility functions:</p>
<table>
  <tr><td>openSSHConnection</td><td>Open an ssh connection!</td></tr>
  <tr><td>transportFiles</td><td>Copy files to or from another
    machine</td></tr>
    <tr><td>testRemoteFiles</td><td>test if a file exists on the
      remote filesystem</td></tr>
     <tr><td>sendSSHCommand</td><td>Invoke a shell command on the
       remote machine</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The supported mechanisms of running on server:</p>
<table>
  <tr><td>test</td><td>Actually runs job locally as test of the
    software</td</tr>
    <tr><td>ssh</td><td>Use sftp to copy files and ssh to start remote
      process</td>
     <tr><td>ssh_shared</td><td>As ssh but relying on server seeing same
       filesystem so no file copying is necessary</td></tr>
     <tr><td>qsub_local</td><td>Submit to <i>qsub</i> job queue has
       'client' on users machine but can access other
       servers.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>qsub_remote</td><td>Submit to <i>qsub</i> job queue that is
      only supported on another machine</td></tr>
      <tr><td>custom</td><td>Use a custom mechanism with code supplied by user</td></tr>
</table>

<p><i>CJobController.doChecks()</i> is called at intervals to perform
various polling functions:
<br><i>checkJobQueue()</i> checks if there are queued jobs and
calls <i>CJobController.runOnServer()</i> if they are to be run on a server.
</p>

<p><i>CJobController.runOnServer()</i> basically does three things:
create a shell script to run the job, copies script and data to remote
machine if necessary, and then, actually in <i>runOnServer2()</i>, start the
job. <i>saveSh()</i> is used to write the shell script that runs the
jo. Note that the script ends with a bit of code to write the process id to a file that
can be read by i2 to recover the process id which used later to check
if the process is still running.  
For the 'ssh_shared' and 'qsub_local' mechanisms the client and server
see the same filesystem so they do not
need files copying to the remote machine but a temporary database file
is specified so the main database file is not also being accessed from
another machine which potentially messes up the database locking. The
<i>transportFiles()</i> method is used to copy files to the remote machine
and this is done in a separate thread to avoid blocking the main
thread and on completion the <i>runOnServer2()</i> method is called.</p>
<p><i>runOnServer2()</i> usually calls either <i>runInSSH()</i> or
<i>runInQsub()</i> to start the job but there is also <i>runLocalTest()</i>
which just runs the job locally (as a basic test of some of the server
code) or calls the custom handler methods. If the job has started
successfully then the <i>CServerParams.pollFinish</i> and
<i>CServerParams.pollReport</i> flags are set appropriately.</p>

<p><i>CJobController.doChecks()</i> also calls:
<br/><i>CJobController.pollRemoteFinish()</i> which checks
<i>CServerParams.pollFinish</i> values 
for any 'remote' jobs that need to be polled to test if finished - if
yes then 1 in every <i>SERVERCHECK</i> cycles 
the appropriate polling mechanism is invoked.
<br/><i>CJobController.pollRemoteReportUpdate()</i> checks
<i>CServerParams.pollReport</i> which flags if there
are remote jobs for which the report can be updated and for 1 in every
<i>REPORTCHECK</i> cycles calls <i>updateReports()</i> to poll the remote machine
for updated <i>program.xml</i>.</p>

<p>Based on the <i>polRemote</i> flag the following methods are called
to check job status:
<br/><i>CJobServer.pollForFinishedFlagFile()</i> groups jobs by machine so
there is only one query per machine tesing for a file called
'FINISHED' in the temporary job directory.
<br/><i>CJobServer.pollQsubStat()</i> Use <i>qstat</i> to find status
of queued job.
<br/>If a job is finished then call <i>handleFinishedServerJob()</i> which
copies files back from a remote machine if necessary and then call
<i>loadRemoteRun()</i> to read the xml database file into temporary tables in
the database and then, if necessary, extract the output data files
from the compressed file. The database temporary tables are then
copied to the main tables and they are deleted. A 'job finished'
signal is emitted so the graphical display is updated.</p>

<p>If the <i>pollReport</i> flag is set then <i>updateReports()</i> is
called. For mechanisms with files on the local disk you might expect the usual
mechanism of watching for file changes with <i>QFileSystemWatcher</i> to
notify of changes to the <i>program.xml</i> but it does not see
changes caused by another machine. So <i>updateReports()</i>
checks if the job <i>program.xml</i> has increased in size and, if so,
emits a 'remoteJobUpdated' signal which is picked up by the
<i>CProjectViewer</i> to force an update of the displayed report.  For jobs
with files on a remote machine <i>updateReports()</i> copies the
<i>program.xml</i> back to the client - the change to the local
<i>program.xml</i> is seen and acted on by the
<i>QFileSystemWatcher</i> mechanism.</p>

<p>The non-graphical script side of i2, <i>bin/runTask.py</i>
and <i>CCP4PluginScript</i> code, has some features to support
running on a server. In particular if the first argument to
<i>bin/runTask.py</i> is not a file with .xml extension then it is
assumed to be a compressed file containing input files and a cutdown
xml database which are unpacked by the <i>CRunPlugin</i> class. The
same class will create a 'final' compressed file including updated xml
version of the database.</p>
<p>If the server
has access to the same filesystem as the client then the important
difference in script running is that it uses a temporary database to
avoid possible issues of two machines accessing the same database. The
xml version of a cutdown database is based to 
<i>bin/runTask.py</i> by the <i>-dbxml</i> argument. <i>CRunPlugin</i>
creates a temporary database and loads from the xml file. It also
creates an updated xml database file on job completion.</p>


<a name="non-graphical"/><h4>Running jobs non-graphically</h4>

<p>It is possible to run a non-graphical process that mimics the i2
interface by starting scripts as separate processes. This is enabled
by the  <i>COpenJob</i> class (in <i>CDbUtils.py</i> file). This class 
was originally intended to cache job information to minimise database
access but now also contains functionality equivalent to that in
<i>CProjectViewer</i> to enable running jobs.  The demo script
<i>developer_projects/COpenJob-2.py</i> shows how to use this in four
steps:
<ul>
<li>instantiate <i>COpenJob</i> with a <i>projectId</i></li>
<li>call <i>COpenJob.createJob()</i> with the name of task required
to run - this will enter a job in the database and return a <i>jobId</i></li>
<li>load <i>COpenJob.container</i> with data - note that
<i>COpenJob.setInputByContextJob(contextJobId)</i> can be used to auto-populate
the input data based on 'following on' from the job with <i>contextJobId</i></li>
<li>call <i>COpenJob.runJob()</i> to start the job</p></li>
</ul>
