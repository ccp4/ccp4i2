abstract = {The commonly used validation metrics for the local agreement of a structure model with the observed electron density, namely the real-space {\it R} (RSR) and the real-space correlation coefficient (RSCC), are reviewed. It is argued that the primary goal of all validation techniques is to verify the accuracy of the model, since precision is an inherent property of the crystal and the data. It is demonstrated that the principal weakness of both of the above metrics is their inability to distinguish the accuracy of the model from its precision. Furthermore, neither of these metrics in their usual implementation indicate the statistical significance of the result. The statistical properties of~electron-density maps are reviewed and an improved alternative likelihood-based metric is suggested. This leads naturally to a {$\chi$}${\sp 2}$ significance test of the difference density using the real-space difference density {\it Z} score (RSZD). This is a metric purely of the local model accuracy, as required for~effective model validation and structure optimization by practising crystallographers prior to submission of a structure model to the PDB. A new real-space observed density {\it Z} score (RSZO) is also proposed; this is a metric purely of the model precision, as a substitute for other precision metrics such as the {\it B} factor.},
