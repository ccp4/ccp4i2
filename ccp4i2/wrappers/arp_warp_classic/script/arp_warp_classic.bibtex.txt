abstract = {The aim of {\it ARP}/{\it wARP} is improved automation of model building and refinement in macromolecular crystallography. Once a molecular-replacement solution has been obtained, it is often tedious to refine and rebuild the initial (search) model. {\it ARP}/{\it wARP} offers three options to automate that task to varying extents: (i) autobuilding of a completely new model based on phases calculated from the molecular-replacement solution, (ii) updating of the initial model by atom addition and deletion to obtain an improved map and (iii) docking of a structure onto a new (or mutated) sequence, followed by rebuilding and refining the side chains in real space. A few examples are presented where {\it ARP}/{\it wARP} made a considerable difference in the speed of structure solution and/or made possible refinement of otherwise difficult or uninterpretable maps. The resolution range allowing complete autobuilding of protein structures is currently 2.0{\AA}, but for map improvement considerable advances over more conventional refinement techniques are evident even at 3.2{\AA} spacing.},
