TI  - Iris: Interactive all-in-one graphical validation of 3D protein model iterations.
PG  - 93-107

AB  - Iris validation is a Python package created to represent comprehensive per-residue 
      validation metrics for entire protein chains in a compact, readable and interactive 
      view. These metrics can either be calculated by Iris, or by a third-party program 
      such as MolProbity. We show that those parts of a protein model requiring attention 
      may generate ripples across the metrics on the diagram, immediately catching the 
      modeler's attention. Iris can run as a standalone tool, or be plugged into existing 
      structural biology software to display per-chain model quality at a glance, with a 
      particular emphasis on evaluating incremental changes resulting from the iterative 
      nature of model building and refinement. Finally, the integration of Iris into the 
      CCP4i2 graphical user interface is provided as a showcase of its pluggable design.
