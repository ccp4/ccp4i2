<h2>Programs</h2>
<p>
LIDIA, PHASER, POINTLESS, ACEDRG, REFMAC, RDKIT, COOT
</p>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>
As part of a chemical-­‐‑probe discovery project, you have established a soakable crystal system into which you have soaked a fragment library. A high resolution structure for &ldquo;apo&rdquo; (ligand free) crystals has been solved, and you are confident that ligand soaking will not change the crystal form (AN ASSUMPTION THAT IS NOT WITHOUT DANGER).
</p>
<p>
You have retrieved your autoprocessed data from the synchrotron and will adopt the unmerged data generated by XIA2 as your start point to find the ligand.
</p>

<h2>Task 1: Data import – Import from Xia2</h2>
<img class="center alt="Import from Xia2" src="Baz2BTutorial1.png"/>
<p>
HINT: The &ldquo;Look in&rdquo; element of the file browser offers a pull-­‐‑down of known project directories from which you might set off to find the files you want to import. At the bottom of the list is &ldquo;CCP4I2_TOP&rdquo; which is an alias for the ccp4i2 source code. For the import xia2 task, you need to locate and select the subdirectory <a href="../baz2b/BAZ2BA_x839.xia2">demo_data/baz2b/BAZ2BA_x839.xia2</a>
</p>
<p>
Now run the job
</p>
<p>
Question: locate the elements of the report that explain the selection of spacegroup, and the selection of output resolution
</p>
 
<h2>Task 2: Ligand pipeline</h2>

<img class="center" alt="Ligand Pipeline Workflow" src="Baz2BTutorial3.png"/>
<p>
Principle inputs to the Ligand pipeline are reflections, an isomorphous model, and a ligand dictionary. This pipeline, however, also embeds two other pipelines (data reduction and make ligand) to allow it to start further upstream, with unmerged data and a sketch, mol file, or SMILES string.
</p>
<p>
There is a small advantage to starting from unmerged data here (since the isomorphous model will be used as a reference to ensure consistent assignment of space group and choice of reciprocal space asymmetric unit)
</p>
<p>
The ligand can be represented with the SMILES string
</p>
<tt>
CN1C(C=Cc2ccccc12)=O
</tt>
<p>
The native PDB file is: <a href="BAZ2B.pdb">BAZ2B.pdb</a>
</p>
<p>

HINT: to make sure no waters are copied across to confuse the ligand placement part of the pipeline, provide the selection:
not (HOH)
