<h2>Programs</h2>
<p>
LIDIA, PHASER, ACEDRG, REFMAC, RDKIT, COOT
</p>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>
(Accurately) informed that there is &ldquo;a lot of chod&rdquo; among the structure ligand complexes in the PDB, you decide to re-solve the structure of everyone's favourite PPI drug target MDM2 in complex with the game-changing tool compound Nutlin 3A.
</p>
<p>
There is a dodgy 1.6 angstrom structure (4hg7) deposited by a disreputable group.... so you plan to use only the deposited reflections for that structure. There is a nice MDM2 structure from another group that you choose for your startpoint (1t4e). You plan to use modern tools to make a start model for Nutlin 3A.
</p>

<h2>Task 1: Molecular replacement – Molrep or Phaser</h2>

<p>
HINT: You can import files (reflections or coordinates) from the PDB directly: in the file browser dialog (accessed by clicking   ): a line at the top allows you to provide the accession code.
</p>
<p>
HINT: Several tasks (e.g. Phaser molecular replacement) allow you to use a &ldquo;selection&rdquo; or subset from the coordinates you provide. For molecular replacement, it may be worthwhile specifying to use only one chain of a model you download: they often contain more than one chain. The syntax for specifying subsets is well worth knowing, but to specify chain A, you need only provide the selection string &ldquo;A/&rdquo; (quotation marks should not be included).
</p>
 
<h2>Task 2: Make your ligand – Make ligand task (LIDIA, ACEDRG, RDKIT)</h2>

<p>
Hint: The structural formula of Nutlin 3A is:

<p>
Hint: Lidia (currently) requires you to click both &ldquo;Apply&rdquo; and &ldquo;Quit&rdquo; to fire up the coordinate generating stuff
</p>
  
<h2>Task 3: Introduce your ligand into the structure (Manual model building: COOT)</h2>
