TI  - REFMAC5 for the refinement of macromolecular crystal structures.
PG  - 355-67
LID - 10.1107/S0907444911001314 [doi]
AB  - This paper describes various components of the macromolecular crystallographic
      refinement program REFMAC5, which is distributed as part of the CCP4 suite.
      REFMAC5 utilizes different likelihood functions depending on the diffraction data
      employed (amplitudes or intensities), the presence of twinning and the
      availability of SAD/SIRAS experimental diffraction data. To ensure chemical and
      structural integrity of the refined model, REFMAC5 offers several classes of
      restraints and choices of model parameterization. Reliable models at resolutions 
      at least as low as 4 A can be achieved thanks to low-resolution refinement tools 
      such as secondary-structure restraints, restraints to known homologous
      structures, automatic global and local NCS restraints, `jelly-body' restraints
      and the use of novel long-range restraints on atomic displacement parameters
      (ADPs) based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. REFMAC5 additionally offers TLS 
      parameterization and, when high-resolution data are available, fast refinement of
      anisotropic ADPs. Refinement in the presence of twinning is performed in a fully 
      automated fashion. REFMAC5 is a flexible and highly optimized refinement package 
      that is ideally suited for refinement across the entire resolution spectrum
      encountered in macromolecular crystallography.

TI  - REFMAC5 dictionary: organization of prior chemical knowledge and guidelines for
      its use.
PG  - 2184-95
AB  - One of the most important aspects of macromolecular structure refinement is the
      use of prior chemical knowledge. Bond lengths, bond angles and other chemical
      properties are used in restrained refinement as subsidiary conditions. This
      contribution describes the organization and some aspects of the use of the
      flexible and human/machine-readable dictionary of prior chemical knowledge used
      by the maximum-likelihood macromolecular-refinement program REFMAC5. The
      dictionary stores information about monomers which represent the constitutive
      building blocks of biological macromolecules (amino acids, nucleic acids and
      saccharides) and about numerous organic/inorganic compounds commonly found in
      macromolecular crystallography. It also describes the modifications the building 
      blocks undergo as a result of chemical reactions and the links required for
      polymer formation. More than 2000 monomer entries, 100 modification entries and
      200 link entries are currently available. Algorithms and tools for updating and
      adding new entries to the dictionary have also been developed and are presented
      here. In many cases, the REFMAC5 dictionary allows entirely automatic generation 
      of restraints within REFMAC5 refinement runs.

TI  - Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method.
PG  - 240-55
AB  - This paper reviews the mathematical basis of maximum likelihood. The likelihood
      function for macromolecular structures is extended to include prior phase
      information and experimental standard uncertainties. The assumption that
      different parts of a structure might have different errors is considered. A
      method for estimating sigma(A) using 'free' reflections is described and its
      effects analysed. The derived equations have been implemented in the program
      REFMAC. This has been tested on several proteins at different stages of
      refinement (bacterial alpha-amylase, cytochrome c', cross-linked insulin and
      oligopeptide binding protein). The results derived using the maximum-likelihood
      residual are consistently better than those obtained from least-squares
      refinement.

TI  - Low-resolution refinement tools in REFMAC5.
PG  - 404-17
LID - 10.1107/S090744491105606X [doi]
AB  - Two aspects of low-resolution macromolecular crystal structure analysis are
      considered: (i) the use of reference structures and structural units for
      provision of structural prior information and (ii) map sharpening in the presence
      of noise and the effects of Fourier series termination. The generation of
      interatomic distance restraints by ProSMART and their subsequent application in
      REFMAC5 is described. It is shown that the use of such external structural
      information can enhance the reliability of derived atomic models and stabilize
      refinement. The problem of map sharpening is considered as an inverse deblurring 
      problem and is solved using Tikhonov regularizers. It is demonstrated that this
      type of map sharpening can automatically produce a map with more structural
      features whilst maintaining connectivity. Tests show that both of these
      directions are promising, although more work needs to be performed in order to
      further exploit structural information and to address the problem of reliable
      electron-density calculation.

TI  - Efficient anisotropic refinement of macromolecular structures using FFT.
PG  - 247-55
AB  - This paper gives the equations for the use of fast Fourier transformations in
      individual atomic anisotropic refinement. Restraints on bonded atoms, on the
      sphericity of each atom and between non-crystallographic symmetry related atoms
      are described. These have been implemented in the program REFMAC and its
      performance with several examples is analysed. All the tests show that
      anisotropic refinement not only reduces the R value and Rfree but also improves
      the fit to geometric targets, indicating that this parameterization is valuable
      for improving models derived from experimental data. The computer time taken is
      comparable to that for isotropic refinements.
