<h2>Programs</h2>
<p>
ACEDRG, PHASER, REFMAC, RDKIT, COOT
</p>

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>
(Accurately) informed that there is &ldquo;a lot of rubbish&rdquo; among the structure ligand complexes in the PDB, you decide to re-solve the structure of everyone’s favourite PPI drug target MDM2 in complex with the game-changing tool compound Nutlin 3A.

There is a dodgy 1.6 Å structure (PDB: 4hg7) deposited by a disreputable group….so you plan to use their deposited reflections, but start from someone else’s model

There is a nice MDM2 structure from another group (4qo4) that you choose for your startpoint. You plan to use modern tools to make a start model for Nutlin 3A. The other model is of a longer construct and you will only use residues 20-107 of Chain A.
</p>

<h2>Task 1: Get the data</h2>

<ol>
<li>Open CCP4i2 and make a new project called MDM2
<li>&ldquo;Utilities&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;Copy demo data to project&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;MDM2&rdquo;
<li>Click the &ldquo;Task menu&rdquo; button in CCP4i2.
<li>Expand the Import merged data, AU contents, alignments or coordinates section.
<li>Create a new Import merged reflection data task
<li>You can import files (reflections or coordinates) from the PDB directly: in the file browser dialog (accessed by clicking  ): a line at the top allows you to provide the accession code (4hg7).

<li>Click &ldquo;Download&rdquo; then once the file has downloaded &ldquo;Open&rdquo; and click &ldquo;OK&rdquo; on the file provenance pop-up.
<li>Enter a name for &ldquo;Crystal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dataset&rdquo;
<li>Click &ldquo;Run&rdquo;
<li>You’ll see a nice report about the quality of the data which should hopefully look familiar. The data from the original file are kept - the report is for analysis only. 
</ol>

<h2>Task 2: Make your ligand – Make ligand task (LIDIA, ACEDRG, RDKIT)</h2>
 
<img height="300" alt="Make Ligand" src="LigandTutorial-mdm2-2.png"/>

<ol>
<li>This takes a while to run so it’s best to do it next. Click the &ldquo;Task menu&rdquo; button in CCP4i2.
<li>Expand the Ligands section.
<li>Create a new Make Ligand – Acedrg job.
<li>The fastest option is to change &ldquo;Start with molecular structure from&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Start point&rdquo; subsection to &ldquo;a SMILES string:<br/>
COc1ccc(c(OC(C)C)c1)C2=N[C@H]([C@H](N2C(=O)N3CCNC(=O)C3)c4ccc(Cl)cc4)c5ccc(Cl)cc5</br>
<li>Perhaps change &ldquo;Three letter code for output monomer&rdquo; to something more informative?
<li>Click &ldquo;Run&rdquo;
</ol>

HINT: The structural formula of Nutlin 3A is:<br/>

<h2>Task 3: Generate a starting model (Molecular replacement: PHASER)</h2>

<ol>
<li>Whilst waiting move on to molecular replacement. First we need to define the contents of the asymmetric unit. Click the &ldquo;Task menu&rdquo; button in the toolbar.
<li>Expand the Import merged data, AU contents, alignments or coordinates section.
<li>Create a new Define AU contents job.
<li>Click &ldquo;Browse for sequence file&rdquo; and load &ldquo;4hg7.seq&rdquo; from the &ldquo;mdm2&rdquo; folder.
<li>Click &ldquo;Run&rdquo;
<li>Click the &ldquo;Task menu&rdquo; button in CCP4i2.
<li>Expand the Molecular replacement section.
<li>Create a new Basic Molecular Replacement – PHASER  job.
<li>The reflection data will be automatically filled in but we need to change &ldquo;Composition of the asymmetric unit&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Composition&rdquo; subsection to &ldquo;Provided as full specification by sequence&rdquo; which should select the output of the Define AU contents job automatically.
<li>For the search model download the coordinates from the PDB directly: in the file browser dialog (accessed by clicking  ): a line at the top allows you to provide the accession code (4qo4).
<li>This is the structure of a longer construct so we need to select only residues 20-107. 
<li>Right click the icon left of &ldquo;Search&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Search model&rdquo; subsection and choose &ldquo;Select atoms&rdquo; Provide the selection string &ldquo;A/20-107&rdquo; (quotation marks should not be included).
<li>Click &ldquo;Run&rdquo;
<li>Does the report indicate molecular replacement has been successful? What is the LLG and TF Z-score?
</ol>

<h2>Task 4: Refine the starting model to create difference density for the ligand (Refinement: REFMAC5)</h2>

<ol>
<li>Click the &ldquo;REFMAC5&rdquo; button at the bottom of the report
<li>This will create a new Refinement – REFMAC5 job with the coordinates from the previous Molecular replacement job already selected. 
<li>Change &ldquo;Number of refinement cycles&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Options&rdquo; subsection to 20.
<li>Click &ldquo;Run&rdquo;
</ol>

<h2>Task 5: Generate a starting model (Interactive model building: COOT, Refinement – REFMAC5)</h2>

<ol>
<li>After 20 cycles R/Rfree should be ~0.35/0.37. Click the &ldquo;COOT&rdquo; button at the bottom of the report.
<li>This will create a new Interactive model building - COOT job with all the inputs appropriately already selected. 
<li>Click &ldquo;Run&rdquo; and inspect the maps. 
<li>Find the ligand density HINT: &ldquo;Validate&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;Unmodelled blobs…&rdquo;
<li>Rebuild (or delete) the sidechains pointing into the ligand density HINT: Y67 and H73.
<li>&ldquo;File&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;Save to CCP4i2&rdquo; when you’re done. 
<li>Close Coot and click the &ldquo;REFMAC5&rdquo; button at the bottom of the report and run the Refinement – REFMAC5 task again – the job is automatically filled with the correct inputs.
</ol>

<h2>Task 6: Introduce your ligand into the structure (Interactive model building: COOT)</h2>

<ol>
<li>Click the &ldquo;COOT&rdquo; button at the bottom of the Refinement – REFMAC5 report.
<li>All the correct inputs are automatically filled in but you need to select the dictionary for the ligand you made earlier as the &ldquo;Geometry dictionary&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Additional data&rdquo; subsection. 
<li>Click &ldquo;Run&rdquo;
<li>Again find the large blob of difference electron density.
<li>Summon coordinates for the ligand (Coot: &ldquo;File&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;Get monomer…&rdquo; and provide the three letter code you gave to the drug).
<li>Invite Coot to place the ligand into the electron density (&ldquo;Ligand&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;Find Ligands…&rdquo;
<li>Tick &ldquo;Flexible?&rdquo; and &ldquo;DRG_from_dict&rdquo; (or whatever you called the ligand).
<li>Click &ldquo;Find Ligands&rdquo;
<li>Merge the positioned ligand into your main coordinates (&ldquo;Edit&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;Merge Molecules…&rdquo;
<li>Write updated coordinates into your CCP4i2 session (&ldquo;File&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;Save to CCP4i2&rdquo; or &ldquo;CCP4i2 extensions&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;Save to CCP4i2&rdquo;
<li> Run the Refinement – REFMAC5 task again and inspect the difference density for your newly fitted ligand.
